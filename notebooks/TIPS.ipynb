       "'Keep in mind before the class: where have we been? where we are? and where are we going?  prioritize life outside of the IAA so you don\\'t get burnt out doing schoolwork all the time! hang out with friends, read books, go on walks, etc. this will help you be more productive in the long run because you\\'re letting your brain and body have a break. When they say \"trust the process,\" you actually should! The staff and faculty have been spent years perfecting the program from start to finish - they know what they are doing. Schedule meetings with the faculty if you need help or have any questions. Use all the resources they provide to you and participate in as many activities as you have time.  when you are interested in an analytic group or a company, network like crazy! Definitely try to talk to as many people as possible at the AIP and have real conversations with them (not just one question). To do this, find people who don\\'t have a huge circle of people around them, or hang back until the last quarter of the networking session. Then, message anyone you talked to on LinkedIn later that day to thank them (reminding them of something you talked about during the session). Later, when it is closer to winter, reach out and have informational calls with MULTIPLE people from the group. Having connected multiple times before this point will increase the chance they will agree to have a video call with you. This technique was VERY helpful for me and I attribute my success in negotiating my salary after receiving an offer to this networking. It helps having people in the company who have extensively talked to you and already like you to be in your corner during the negotiation stage.\\n Take good care of yourself. Getting adequate sleep, going for a walk, or taking time to reset can help you stay active and energized during the program. Analyzing data is hard. It is complicated, convoluted, and downright confusing at times. You may not have time to know everything and dive deep into why some methodologies work. That\\'s okay. You will not master the 10+ topics you cover over the year, but the faculty will prepare you to have a broad overstanding into the main concepts of each topic. If you are interested in learning more about a certain analytical method, doing a side project is an excellent way to deepen your knowledge and have something to talk about during your job interview process. If you ever forget your lunch at home, consider eating at the On the Oval Dining Hall instead of the food trucks. They can be pretty expensive.  Discover and analyze your learning style and routine. How you learn is just as important as what you learn, so take the time in summer and early fall to find a system that works well for you! For some reason, a lot of people think it\\'s necessary to scare you about how busy things get when you\\'re in the program. You may hear things like \"say goodbye to your friends and family for a year,\" or \"cancel Netflix because there\\'s no such thing as free time,\" or \"sleep is going to be hard to come by.\" Although the program is strenuous and will require you to work beyond your comfort zone, statements intended to scare you are oftentimes exaggerated, and sometimes, downright untrue. If your family and friends are important to you, you will be able to make the time to see them. If Netflix is important to you, there\\'s plenty of downtime as long as you budget your time responsibly. If sleep is important to you, there\\'s plenty of time to consistently get a good night\\'s rest. Remember that things aren\\'t going to be half as bad as people say they are as long as you work hard and stay on top of things,  Grades DO matter. It\\'s okay if you get a poor grade on an assignment here or there, but you\\'ll be expected to maintain a GPA. Do not slack off in your classes! Ask your classmates for help and be ready to listen Be sure to get into a routine early on within the summer, as you will greatly thank yourself later. The workload really picks during the fall semester and having this routine will help to maximize your learning and limit the stress of the program. Comment your code with the procedural or analytical thought processes. With complex modeling procedures, it can be difficult to remember why certain chunks of code are being used. As you are learning things in class, comment your code with why this concept/test/step is necessary and how it fits into the big picture.  Take care of your mental health!   \"Trust the process\" means doing your best on the tasks IAA encourages you to do, in the right order and at the right time. During the Summer and Fall terms, focus on building solid technical skills (regularly summarizing critical points for technical interviews), engaging in teamwork (saving stories for behavioral questions), and networking with alums and industry experts. Read your textbooks. They have so much analytics insights and go beyond what is discussed in class. The early part of the summer is definitely the best time to make some new friends and learn to play ping pong. Bring your own fork.\\n Maintain your schedule through the year. There is still time to take care of yourself. Make friends with or be friendly to everyone. While the point of the program is not to make friendships, it is a great added bonus. You are surrounded by this group of people all day every day in classes, homework teams, practicum, etc. You get friendly with them very quick and they become your support system. Lean on them. But more importantly, develop a friendly relationship with as many people as possible. Don\\'t just find a good few in the first week and stick only to them. I really appreciated talking to everyone and having a wide array of connections and supporters.  I Won\\'t Back Down -- Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (1989)\\n\\nThis is the mindset you need to be successful here at the Institute. There will be long days and nights of work. You need grit and perseverance.  Read your feedback. It will help you grow,  Analyze your weaknesses so you can address them, and the best part is that it will help you know all the amazing things you do have to offer. Be fully invested in all the work of the program. All of the classes, workshops, projects, and events contribute something valuable to your growth as an analytics professional, and putting intentional effort and focus in will help you get the most out of it! There\\'s going to be a lot of tips focusing on how stressful the program will be, and the need to prepare for the heavy workload ahead. The program will be stressful, and there will be a lot of work. But don\\'t let this overwhelm you. If you manage your time wisely, you will still have time for doing the things that you enjoy. The ten months ahead will be difficult but they can be a lot of fun too.  The first and most important thing to remember is that you are at the IAA for a reason and your qualifications and skills have brought you there. Don\\'t question that throughout the process, even if you feel like people around you are smarter or better at coding, etc. Keep learning and taking in as much as you can, be a good teammate, do your share of work, and you will be a successful IAA student. Try to fight procrastination as much as you can. There are a lot of things to keep track of during the program, and it can be burdensome when you procrastinate small tasks and suddenly it becomes overwhelming. Try to do your assignments when they\\'re assigned, not when they\\'re due. This might be the best productivity hack for this program - at least for me, it was much more effective than making to do lists all the time. The things on your to do list don\\'t go away unless you knock them out. It\\'s better to simplify things! Make time to step away from the program and focus on enjoying rest, friends & family, or anything else that helps you recharge your battery. The busyness of the program comes in waves, so create a schedule that allows you to take time for your mental health no matter where your schedule stands. Practice SQL and Python everyday. Take the time to form friendships during the summer and Fall 1! Things really pick up afterward and you don\\'t have as much free time to get to know your classmates, especially those placed in the other cohort, so try to socialize up front. Your classmates will be a wonderful support system for you throughout the process. Everyone is going through the program and facing similar struggles, so don\\'t miss out on the opportunity to form enduring genuine connections. You are each others cheerleaders! Every day, write down three highlights from the Institute. If you don\\'t know where to begin, focus on both interactions and significant transitions—like unanticipated lunch conversations and starting new classes, respectively. I have hundreds of memories and quotes cataloged that I love to share with my now great friends. Even on rough days, find three gems!  Keep your mind open and ready for both personal and professional growth. This program is difficult but well worth every second. You will change, learn, and change again. You can always process any of this with your coach, they are there for you! If you are less comfortable with coding, volunteer for coding tasks on team projects. It is easy to get overwhelmed by the deadlines and stick to what you know better, but this really limits your learning. [Summer tip] Imposter syndrome is a common theme amongst all students. It\\'s ok if you come in with less knowledge of coding/stats - you\\'ll re-use and practice everything you\\'ve learned in class! You\\'d be surprised that many students come in being code novices and might be coding leads for a homework team in the fall or spring! You may feel a little lost initially but follow the classes, take notes (ex. oneNote, notion, thousands of apps), review, and DON\\'T be afraid to ask for help from classmates or professors. The first few presentations may seem scary, but I promise you\\'ll appreciate it later! A Tips project hint - be creative and try everything!  Start studying for certifications as early as possible. Life can start to feel overwhelming pretty quick, but you will be learning so much information.  At the end of the day, when it\\'s all said and done, when the facts are on the ground, what it all really boils down to, is the bottom line. Do yourself a huge favor and go through the Foundations of Tableau modules through Tableau\\'s eLearning site BEFORE Fall 2. You have so much time to do it in the summer, trust me. Take thorough and consistent notes in class. Using OneNote or another note software really helps keep consistency when taking notes and holds them all in one place. This can be a great reference down the stretch with the Practicum. Maybe you\\'ll make \"best friends\", maybe you won\\'t. But you\\'ll certainly make wonderful colleagues, so push yourself to go out of your comfort zone and try new things and attend group events that you maybe normally wouldn\\'t! I don\\'t regret any of the various outings I attended.  If you have little to no prior experience with coding, focus on a single resource for Python and SQL. Spend 30 minutes a day in the Summer for these as it will immensely help during Fall and Spring. Getting better at data analysis using these tools will help you stand out in the industry and the overall job market. \\nThe faculty in the program are simply exceptional and always willing to help. Work on a side project throughout the fall semester. They help with your comprehension of the material and with interviews. Make friends in the program during the Summer term. If you are a very outgoing person, make an additional effort to get to know your classmates who are more reserved. It can be lonely for a lot of people. The program is only 10 months - give it your all for that time! This doesn\\'t mean that it should dominate your entire life. Still maintain balance with your social life, stay active, do things for fun, etc., but also don\\'t be afraid to go above and beyond or spend extra time on things that you think may set you apart. Do the side project you were considering embarking on, and document it thoroughly. Put in the extra time re-watching lectures or studying notes on that one concept that you know is important but you were kind of confused on. Send the LinkedIn messages and schedule the informational interviews with your connections at prospective employers. None of these things are required, but they will all be incredibly valuable in the hiring process, whether it\\'s establishing a connection, giving you something great to talk about in an interview, or making sure you\\'re secure on any technical concept they could ask about. Doing things like this will maximize your chances of success come spring. You have unique skills that make you a wonderful student and future employee. Remember that!. You are capable of completing the program. The institute chose you to be in the program for a reason. Knowing this can bring confidence to team work and job interviews. This may be the most cliche statement ever (and you\\'ve probably already read this 100+ times), but, truly, the days are long but the year is short. This program does cover a LOT in a short amount of time, and some days can really feel like they drag on forever. But I can promise you that what you learn here is incredibly valuable from an employment standpoint, the student body is so diverse and fun, and it will be over sooner than you know it. So enjoy (and trust!) the process, spend time with your fellow classmates, and make the most of these short ten months :) The job search during the spring semester will be intense, so I recommend doing an intensive review during the winter break.  It is okay if you don\\'t make close friends in this program right away! I didn\\'t become close friends with my classmates until Fall 2, and that is perfectly okay. Sometimes the best relationships just take a little longer to develop. Do your certifications as early as you can, it only gets harder to make time for them as the year goes on. Maintain perspective. The program is short, be willing to make short term sacrifices and it feel less overwhelming. Don\\'t worry about what the hardest part of the program is; it\\'s all hard up until maybe halfway through Spring 2. But do keep in mind that the job search hits you HARD coming out of your winter break. If I were to go back again, I would have focused on my interview prep (doing coding challenges (SQL + Python), practicing detailing my practicum, explaining machine learning, reading through my Ace the Data Science Interview book) during the tail end of the winter break. Do give yourself a solid break, but maybe give yourself five days before the break ends to start interview prep.  Take care of yourself physically. Go to the gym, do not skip meals, and get a good night\\'s sleep regularly. Don\\'t listen to the outside noise about how difficult or busy the program is. It all comes down to time management. Know your limits, what subjects you struggle with, what subjects you\\'re better in, and use those to stay on top of the curriculum at all times. Time management is everything! Don\\'t over do it. Dedicate some time to yourself throughout the week to keep yourself grounded, and to have something outside of school work to look forward to Exercise. This program will be time consuming and often the last thing you will feel like doing is working out, but I promise even just a 10 minute workout (there are so many good videos on youtube!) will leave you feeling healthier and refreshed to keep going. And when you inevitably get side tracked and realize you stopped working out, forgive yourself and just start again. Your body and mind will thank you. Focus on prioritization. You won\\'t have enough time to put 100% effort into everything. Focus on the things that are most essential first and don\\'t beat yourself up if you didn\\'t perform perfectly at everything. Spring 3 is only the Practicum project. It is time designed for primarily working on your final paper and presentation. Ensuring that all of your work: model building, scorecards, analytics is done well in advance of Spring 3 will ensure your time can be focused on your deliverables and not trying to complete analytics work while juggling paper rough drafts and presentation reviews. Try to start networking and interview prepping early, the job search comes really quick You may read a lot of other tips that say Fall 2 is the most stressful. It was pretty hectic and a busy time. BUT, if you work better with a schedule and struggle with unstructured time/last minute plans then Spring 1 will probably be more stressful for you. Interviews will come out of no where. There could be days where you aren\\'t sure if you have an interview tomorrow until 7pm that night. Try to keep your schedule as free as possible during the blocked off interview times.  Take a little extra time in the summer and early fall to really get comfortable and practice with R (and Python too -- you can do it!). When a programming-related concept \"clicks\" its an amazing feeling.  Take the initiative. If there is something you want to learn, or figure out, don\\'t wait for it to be taught to you. Go learn about it, consult faculty and staff, ask questions, and use external resources. This is especially true for the practicum but also for any subject matter, academic or professional. You should try to take the initiative wherever possible, even in your career and in your life to achieve the outcomes you are hoping for. USE ONENOTE. Start this SUMMER, don\\'t wait. I thought I was only a paper note taker and I\\'m old so I thought it wasn\\'t for me. It doesn\\'t matter. It is for you. OneNote will help you store all important things quickly. A one stop searchable shop for your brain. Lifesaver. The days are long but the year is short AKA your time at the institute really will fly by  I remember being anxious about who my sponsor company was, despite Dr. Rappa emphasizing that it doesn’t really matter at the end of the day. And he was absolutely right- your practicum team is what makes the experience! You’ll spend so much time with them that they become like family. Plus, the industry your practicum is in has no bearing on where you’ll work. My practicum was for a consulting company, and my team members got jobs in sports analytics, tech, financial services, and national security.  Don\\'t feel like a loser if classmates are advancing in interviews and you\\'re not. Your time and fit will come. Especially if this is your first \\'real\\' job, interviewing will take some getting used to, but Career Services (Kate and April), faculty, and your classmates are great resources to help you out. A lot of us felt imposter syndrome coming into the MSA. A lot of us feel imposter syndrome as we start our new jobs. Know that you all have worked hard to be here and deserve your spot in the IAA:) You will hear a lot \"Trust the process\" in the program. My advice would be to believe in that as long as you are putting enough effort and following the school\\'s advice along the way. Focus on learning, improving your soft skills, and remember that everything you are doing as part of this program is there for a reason.  Be sure to build a fitness routine into your schedule. Group Fitness classes are a great free way to destress! My favorites were cardio step, cycle, yoga, and hip hop. I also took aggressively long walks around Lake Raleigh, and did Kathy/ Joe\\'s Koru meditation class. You do have time if you make it a priority. You will likely see a lot of tips talking about how intense the program is, or which module is the hardest. Don\\'t let them phase you too much or make you nervous. Instead let it be motivation to push through these next 10 months as best as you can, It will be over before you know it. Really go out of your way to learn new technologies. Spark, Cloud, Tensorflow. The best data scientists are adaptable! Pay special attention in summer, it\\'ll serve as the basis for everything that\\'s to come The nights are long but the year is short. Put in the work and you will be rewarded on the other side. If you don\\'t put in the work, well you just wasted your own time and money.  Work on a side project. Even if you don’t finish it it will provide a great talking point in interviews.  It sounds cliché, but it really is vital to not compare yourself to other people. Theres 100-something people in the class, and each one has something to offer and comes from their own unique background with their own unique set of experiences. What matters most is whether or not YOU gain new skills, learn, improve, etc. Do not be afraid to ask for help if you are stuck! Your peers, TAs, IAA staff, and IAA faculty are there to help you be successful. Everyone has there own strengths, so do not feel like an imposter if something does not \"click\" immediately. Just about every student in the program will struggle with some aspect of the program at some point — whether that be adjusting to being in school again, the coursework, or getting code to work. It is important to recognize and embrace your weaknesses from the beginning and not shy away from addressing them.  Use Google Calendar. Especially if you are a lead it is important to keep that updated because people will frequently forget when meetings are if it is not on their calendars. Take the program one month at a time. Take notes during the AIPs! There were a lot of them and taking good notes was super helpful for interview season. ONE NOTE - This is where your life will live. Download the slide deck before class and take notes on the slides. Use it also organize all the AIPs and networking conversations you have. People will ask you for your notes and you will be happy you have them.  Make sure you schedule time to take a break. When you get busy it gets hard to step away. So make sure you schedule in break time or some kind of activity so that you can recharge. You have FREE COUNSELING. FREE THERAPY. USE IT. You will often hear the mantra \\'Trust the Process,\\' and it is important to trust that the faculty at the IAA know what to do to set you up for success. However, it is equally, if not more, essential to value the process. It is easy to fixate on the results, from how you did on a test to if you got a job or not. All the work you put in and the growth you experience are valuable. What you do along the way matters, and it is important not to lose sight of that. Don\\'t be afraid to go to office hours. The program goes by really fast so it\\'s important to keep up with what is being taught and going to office hours can really help clear up anything that might be confusing.  If you are struggling with something ask for help. The faculty and TA\\'s are all very nice and helped me multiple times with different topics that I didn\\'t understand the first time. Make sure to take time to prioritize life outside of the institute (passions, relationships, etc). These will be extremely important in making the year a good experience.  Put EVERYTHING in your Google calendar! Not only will it keep you organized, but it will keep your team leads from scheduling over important events. Keep track of it and keep it up to date. Stay up-to-date with assignments as you find out about them. You never know everything you’re going to have to do as you’re always finding out about more assignments. I was always so glad I didn’t wait, even if I submitted something a week early.  Network hard right NOW. While it is very much likely that your networking may not yield a way into a job, use those opportunities to learn about different industries, and establish contacts with people you may want to hit up later in your career. The difficult part is continuing contact beyond the first call, so work on trying to socially engage if you can. Career services gives lots of suggestions on how to network in the fall, and they are all great tips (many people get interviews with certain companies solely because they reached out to them on LinkedIn and had a chat). Treat networking as a required part of the program and force yourself to reach out - even if you\\'re extremely anxious and nervous (like I was). It was extremely valuable to learn how to talk to professionals that you don\\'t know and a lot of my success in interview season came from how comfortable I was in those situations because I networked a lot. Besides, eventually your nerves will subside as you become more comfortable with the process.  Once you’re accepted, the competition is over. Lean on your peers, appreciate each other’s strengths and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. Those are the times you’ll grow the most.  Don\\'t discount the importance of building relationships in this program. You will meet some lifelong friends if you put yourself out there. Go to social events early and often. Don\\'t let others do work for you. The best way to learn the material especially coding is to try it yourself first. Failing is the most helpful teacher and everyone will experience it at some point at the IAA don\\'t shy away from it just embrace it. You will work incredibly hard during this program, but make sure to take some time to relax and reset.  Take the time to get to know your classmates. I started going to social events as early as the primer, and I\\'m so glad I did. Even if it feels outside your comfort zone to go to an event where you barely know anyone, take the chance, you\\'ll be glad you did. This program is really enhanced by the people, both inside and outside the classroom.  A great method to study for quizzes/exams is to rewatch lectures. It is sometimes difficult to capture all the information the first time in class, so listening to it a second time and taking notes helps. Take good notes! You are learning a lot of material in a short period of time so don\\'t wait until last minute to organize your notes. Good notes will also help you a lot during interview season. Mike is incredible patient with IT problems. I sat in his office for hours and he never gave up. If you feel frustrated solving a problem on your own don\\'t be afraid to ask for help. Take advantage of every resource the institute offers! Whether thats office hours, counseling, coaching, your tuition covers a lot of benefits at the IAA and NCSU that you should be using to get the most out of your experience Use Google Calendar. It will be a lifesaver in the fall when classes, practicum, and homework picks up. Things can get overwhelming, make sure to prioritize yourself in addition to school work. Prioritize your mental health. It will be easy to get swept away in the stress of the program, but you should always take care of yourself. Make sure to eat, sleep, and have fun as much as possible! For anyone that is a worrier or has anxiety about this upcoming experience: have faith in yourself! I had major anxiety coming into this experience, especially being someone with minimal workforce experience and almost no relevant experience. Seeing how qualified and experienced so many of my classmates were really made me worry about my ability to have success. But this isn\\'t something that should bring you down. You hardly ever work alone so having brilliant classmates is a huge advantage! Try to learn from them.  But more importantly, understand that you are smart and capable enough to navigate this program. You will bring something strong to the table. Figure out your strengths and weaknesses and let your strengths shine while always trying to improve upon your weaknesses. If you do that, there\\'s nothing you will be completely fine. Don\\'t be shy to ask for help. Take advantage of the staff and faculty, TA to clarify our doubts.  Highly recommend using OneNote for notetaking for both online and in-person classes. Stay focused on what you want to get out of this program. Want more experience coding? Volunteer to take on more coding tasks in your homework and practicum teams. Want to make long lasting friendships and networking relationships? Make the time to get to know your classmates and actively reach out to alumni to network. Want to get a job? Make sure you use the career services resources available to you and take the time to get those certificates. You won\\'t have a lot of time to spare during this busy program so make sure you focus your attention and time on what you want, and don\\'t waste time stressing too much and comparing yourself to others. You definitely have time to engage in extracurricular activities. I was unsure about joining a dance company at NCSU because I was worried about the time commitment. You absolutely have/can make the time; it is incredibly important to carve out time for your passions and hobbies—no matter how much time it might take.  Don\\'t be afraid to admit when you\\'re wrong. It goes a long way when interacting with team members. You never want to be the person who wastes everyone\\'s time when you know you are wrong. You also will gain the respect of every team member once you become comfortable admitting when you\\'re wrong. Lean on the friends you\\'ll make in the IAA as a support system during busy modules! They\\'ll understand what you\\'re going through and be a great sounding board. Get to know your classmates! The program is an awesome opportunity to form lasting friendships so don\\'t shy away from the social events, even when things get busy. Go to social events early on! At the beginning of the program you will be tempted to spend all your time studying/trying to get ahead but you\\'ll eventually settle into a routine and realize you don\\'t need to spend a bunch of extra time \"getting ahead\" so that time early on is much better used getting to know your classmates. The IAA does a terrific job selecting fun/smart/interesting people so there is a high chance you will make lifelong friends in this program so don\\'t miss out on that opportunity! Try to connect socially with your fellow classmates, especially early on! In the later modules, you\\'ll become inundated with schoolwork (Fall 2, Fall 3, and Spring 1 are the toughest by far!) and may not have the time to socialize as much. You\\'re forged through the fire with some incredible individuals and will make some fantastic new friends if you take the time! I know a lot of these tips are going to be about the job process or things that seem so far away, but you will have access to this document all year, and I really found it helpful to go back to these tips as you approach different parts of the process!  Make sure to not skip meals Get plenty of rest Run your own race with the job search. Dr. Rappa\\'s emails can be anxiety inducing, but have faith that you will get a job—even in the darkest of hours. Go to Angus Barn in Raleigh with friends and get the Chocolate Chess Pie. Take time to do the things you enjoy. You\\'ll end up doing a better job with a clear mind after doing things you like to do. Hang out with your friends, go to sporting events, go work out, etc. The work will be there when you get back. Practice with Python and R the most you can. Best way to do this isn\\'t necesarily a side project, just think of something fun like a poker simulator or roulette sim to find the best strategy and try to see it through. It gives you the most experience to get comfortable with the basics, and its fun to do. You\\'re probably freaking out while reading some of these tips but honestly its gonna be OK. Pay attention in class, ask questions, be a good teammate, and you\\'ll be at the finish line before you know it. It can be difficult to learn virtually, so find a good way to take notes and stay focused. I preferred to always download the powerpoints before class and take notes using One Note alongside the zoom window. I am sure many people will say this, but do not compare yourself to others. You don\\'t have to have the exact same career aspirations as your classmates. Your classmates are all starting from different places and have different skills and experiences. Compare yourself to who you were at the beginning of the program or how your skills have progressed compared to a month ago.  Send that extra email, make that extra phone call, and send that one more LinkedIn DM. It just might be the difference between you and another candidate. Especially if you really like a company reach out RIGHT AWAY AFTER AN INFO SESSION. Don\\'t wait around until they come to you or till you see the email from April that they\\'re recruiting, if you like them go ahead and contact people there early on. I found that I was only getting interviews from companies where I had already spoken to someone.  Make it a priority to get to know your classmates socially! These will be the people who you can go to for help during the program, and will be your network in the analytics community after graduating. Plus it\\'ll make the program that much more fun. Don’t be afraid to show weakness and ask for help when you don’t understand. There is no stupid question. Chances are someone else also has the same question. This also applies to when you are overworking yourself or when unexpected personal life events occur! Let your team know if you need help you finishing something that was assigned to you because you have too much on your plate and/or something unexpected happened in your life. Your classmates will understand and be there for you as long as you communicate it.\\n\\nBONUS: Spring will be rough if you don\\'t get an offer in Round 1 and/or aren\\'t getting as many interviews as your classmates, but you will be okay and don\\'t compare yourself to them. Trust the process. Don\\'t lose yourself! Remember all the great things you have accomplished. You are smart and strong. Good things come to those who wait. Don\\'t keep your stress and anxiety bottled in! Reach out to a friend, your practicum team, or a coach and talk about it. Don\\'t go through this alone. If you are one of the fortunate ones to get an offer Round 1, support your peers by sharing opportunities you see, giving LinkedIn recommendations, and being open to interview prep. Be there for your classmates! Go see Joe (counseling). It is absolutely worth it. If you want to work at a specific company, network with the alumni who work there. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll be at a disadvantage when the company is deciding which candidates to select. Alumni are also usually happy to talk with you since they\\'ve been in your shoes before. Retry assignments in a different language. It helps with understanding and also improving your programming. Do not compare yourself to others. You all ended up here! Early on I was very aware of my non-technical background and thought I would be overshadowed by my stats and compsci peers. First of all, it\\'s not a competition! You are in this together. Later, I found out many of them saw skills in me which they wish they had. We all wish we had learned something different prior. YOU WILL LEARN EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO AT THE IAA. Don\\'t trust an empty calendar  Fall is hard, the job search is hard, but always make sure to cherish the relationships with your classmates. Go to the hangout. Make friends with your classmates and hang out outside of class -- these are awesome people, and I really enjoyed spending time with them. Organization is your #1 friend. With so much going on it can feel like a bunch of flies are buzzing around your head. Prioritize what needs to be done, and get right on knocking them out. When it feels like you don\\'t have enough time in the day to take a break, that\\'s probably when you need it the most. You\\'ll be refreshed and more efficient with your work than if you try to power through. For virtual learning: get a second monitor! It will be helpful to have your notes up on one screen while you watch the lecture on the other. Enjoy the slower pace of the summer session.  Things will get much busier in the Fall (I cannot emphasize this enough…), and its key to take the opportunity to spend time with your friends and loved ones over the summer.  The next time you will have real downtime will be in December. Be Disciplined. It is too easy to look at your phone in lecture or zone out in a meeting while on a zoom call. Be disciplined enough to focus on all of the lectures, meetings, and employer sessions. Have a dedicated area in your house/apartment for school work. Trust me, it is easier to just listen the first time rather than re-watching a pre-recorded lecture.  Leverage Joe and the coaches as much as you want/need to. They are there to help, and they help tremendously. Especially while virtual, make sure to schedule recurring in-person (virtual is good but not the same) social events with peers, while keeping appropriate pandemic precautions.  Don\\'t be afraid to put something out there - you may be afraid that nobody will show up, but odds are people will come.  You can even coordinate privately with one or two people to achieve a \"critical mass\" before passing along the invitation to the full class.  This year, student-initiated/led in-person social events included weekly hikes, pickup soccer/basketball, occasional hangouts at Dix Park, a Thanksgiving celebration outdoors, etc.  Virtual is good but not at all the same as in-person!  Put in the work to build intentional friendships with your peers - doing so is well worth it. Know and appreciate the behind-the-scenes work that all the staff do to keep the IAA running. For every hour of time you experience, the IAA will have put a lot of hours into making it happen. Nothing\\'s perfect, and that\\'s fine.  It\\'s tempting to procrastinate for fear of doing something well but not perfectly (see this TEDTalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52lZmIafep4), but this sacrifices the good at the altar of the perfect and is incredibly counterproductive.  When you finish your code, could you have done something slightly more efficiently?  Maybe, and you should certainly do your best, but you can figure out efficiency enhancements if you have time once you get some working code up and running (good code, even if not perfectly optimized code, is much better than no code or rushed bad code). Lean into the academic/professional diversity of the group. Some peers will be straight out of undergrad in their early 20s, while others will be seasoned professionals in their 40s. They all bring different knowledge and perspectives to the table, and it\\'s important to neither dismiss nor become intimidated by their experience. Also, some people will come from technical backgrounds while others won\\'t, and that\\'s ok. Learn from one another (there\\'s a reason you\\'re all here) and use your experience (whatever it may be) to help your team. Joe Burke\\'s free counseling sessions are a really great resource that the Institute provides. The program can be really stressful at times, particularly during job search season. It is important to take care of your mental health, and Joe can help with that. If you\\'re starting to feel overwhelmed, give a session with Joe a chance. The way to make the most of Dr. Healey\\'s lectures may be a bit different than how you make the most of lectures by other faculty. Dr. Healey creates a webpage with his lecture notes for every class he teaches and provides a link on Moodle. Going through some of that content before he teaches it in class can help you follow along better. Also, if he provides optional problems for you to work through, take the time to give them a shot. They can be challenging, and you\\'ll likely have to search through some documentation in the process, but it can be really worthwhile (also, being able to read documentation is an important skill for a data scientist). Don\\'t hesitate to schedule time to meet with Dr. Healey either. He\\'s really generous with his time and enjoys meeting with students. He might seem intimidating, but he\\'s a really nice person. This program operates primarily in teams. Intentionally think about what kind of teammates you’d like to work with, and then think about what practical steps you can take to become that kind of teammate yourself.  If there are moments/days/weeks when you feel overwhelmed, it means you are learning and growing. Imagine if you didn\\'t feel challenged by this program -- what would it all be for?? Embrace the challenge, take it one week at a time, and lean on your classmates and professors! If you never had experience with Python, learn some fundamental coding in Summer, so you won\\'t feel completely lost later on. Never trust an empty calendar --- but do try to set aside time for yourself! when you study all those different subjects, try to make a review sheet for the future interview. I think it can save a lot of time and make you feel less stress. Don\\'t be afraid to try things you are uncomfortable with, believe in yourself! Networking may be annoying, but it is the best resource to getting a job. Networking with IAA Alumni from companies hiring internally is crucial as they are going to be looking at 120 different students. Use LinkedIn and IAA Faculty/Staff to help with networking. Reach out to your classmates virtually (and in-person) right away! The easiest time to make friends in the program is in the summer. Everyone who gets into this program is extremely friendly, interesting, and worth getting to know! While all my experience was virtual, I think it was beneficial to read many of the \"get to know me\" entries from the cohort as I found that to be a good way to start conversations with people. Especially as someone who isn\\'t the most outgoing in large groups, being able to have those personal 1-on-1 conversations really helped me feel part of the cohort early on.   If you\\'re coming for a 2nd or 3rd career, you are going to be a leader in some shape. Some of your classmates have never worked before and you will be leaned on. Your lived experience is very valuable and it will definitely be rewarded once the job search begins.  Don\\'t forget the importance of learning the analytics. The institute teaches you much more than analytics. You will become a better presenter, a better communicator, and a better teammate throughout the program. These are the skills that help set you apart from other candidates, but these are skills that are needed on top of great analytics. If you are able to build a great presentation, but your analysis is faulty, it doesn\\'t matter how good your presentation is, your results won\\'t be useful. Knowing the material and having a strong understanding of the intuition behind the technical skills that are taught will ultimately help you become confident in the work you present and the value that you bring to your practicum and homework teams.      Plan, plan, plan. You will be so busy that if you don\\'t put in on your calendar it probably won\\'t happen If possible, get a head start on learning Python and R! Take advantage of all the recourses available to you -- if not because they\\'re good for you, then at least because you paid a lot of money for them!  Get active on LinkedIn today! Here\\'s a freebie post idea: Write a about the one topic you are most excited to learn about during your masters program. Then, write a single post each week sharing something you learned about, whether it\\'s how to do a t-test, logistic regression, or network centrality. It can be small - just share your learnings and progress. Comment on other people\\'s posts too. That\\'s networking! That\\'s how you create real professional connections! It pays off: recruiters and hiring managers reached out to ME during job hunting season because I posted regularly. Last year I was reading tips from the previous cohorts just like you. Now 10 month later I am sitting here writing my tips. Value your time at the IAA and get as much as you can out of the program. Connect with faculties! They are sooooo nice and they are happy to talk to you. Connect with classmates and alums. We are your best resource! By the end, you will be surprised by how fast time slips through your fingers. Lean on your peers. Many of the students in the IAA come from very unique and interesting backgrounds. Most people have had some experience looking at a problem in a certain way versus your perspective. Utilize your teammates and fellow students on assignments, coding problems, or course material. It is a win-win. You get to learn something and a fellow student gets to teach it. More often than not, I went and looked for help or guidance from my classmates. It was a wonderful strategy to use to meet others and solve problems using team work. Faculty and staff are obviously there to help you and they are exceptional people too but I do believe that looking for the answers to questions with my peers helped prepare me for success throughout the program. You have been primarily doubted your whole life... mainly by yourself. As you come into the program and grow throughout the year, remember that your mind is your greatest friend and worst enemy. There is a reason why you were admitted and it\\'s because everyone knows you\\'re capable. You just need to believe that within yourself! Challenge yourself to work on the programming languages that scare you/that you might not be as comfortable with (for me it was Python). It\\'s easy to resort to using the languages that you\\'re more comfortable with, particularly when things get busy, but you\\'ll be happy that you chose to get better at new languages at the end of the program - I promise! You will need more than one screen if you are going to study from home Normalize 1-on-1s with every team you are on (you will especially have the ability to do this when you are a practicum or a homework team lead). Doing them from the very beginning takes off the pressure, allows you to get to know your teammates better (especially when the program is virtual), and makes it so you can address any issues as and when they come up.  Schedule time with faculty to chat about class concepts, but also personal projects and career interests. This is especially easy to do in a virtual environment Spend the time to learn Python and R at the beginning of the program. Most of the companies that interviewed students using the internal process required one or the other.  It\\'s harder to build a good team virtually, but it\\'s still important. Be creative in how you work on this, like having social hours for practicum or chatting with homework teammates before/after team meetings.  If you don\\'t get something that you really want, just ask. The worst that can happen is nothing changes.  Take a break from time to time and hang out with people from the program! The faculty are amazing and all super helpful, do not be afraid to go to them if you have any questions or are struggling with certain material or even just want to talk! Set clear expectations with your practicum and homework teams regarding your working hours, especially virtually Don\\'t sweat the small stuff and keep a positive outlook!  When looking for a job, do not prioritize salary, but rather company culture and potential for leadership/growth. If you receive an offer considerably lower than the class average, 1. you may be able to negotiate, 2. self-reflect on what YOU want and not what people think, 3. ask about the opportunities for growth/timelines (your classmates\\' offers may be $20k more, but they may also be in a role that doesn\\'t provide much opportunity for promotions/growth). Don\\'t waste too much time figuring out your \"productivity\" system. Pick something that will back up digitally and is easily accessible and flexible for your needs. OneNote is popular because you can post slides and write notes directly with an ipad (for those that prefer handwritten).  Peer feedback is the most useful thing you will get out of this program. Be really thoughtful in how you approach giving and receiving feedback. Being honest and detailed helps you evaluate your own reactions too - if you thought someone was slacking, but when you make a list of what they did you find they were not, you will need to evaluate why you thought that about the person. It can help you notice your unconscious biases, and also what you do unconsciously that affects others. However, do take care to make your feedback as anonymous as possible. While you might not care if someone figures out that your feedback comes from you, if it\\'s obvious which comments are yours you just made it that much easier to figure out who gave the other feedback on your team - and your teammates may not appreciate that. Try wearing different hats when it comes to assignment collaborations (e.g. you code or you write or both), this way you can get a feeling of what suits you the best, but please do remember that it is business not personal.  If any of your classes are virtual, there will be times when you feel so dumb because you aren\\'t getting it and you can\\'t look up and see all of your classmates also confused. First: remember that you\\'re not dumb. And second: **make a friend!!** Make a friend so that you can text/slack them when you\\'re confused so you don\\'t feel all alone. Spend time reaching out to folks you know asking if they can put you in touch with someone. Your network is bigger than you think, and people will be eager to help! Grades are not your ultimate goal. Learning is. As long as you are passing the courses, grades are only useful as feedback. Thus, focus your efforts on what you want and need to learn. Unfamiliar with R? Challenge yourself to build a dashboard. Never used Python? Use an API to build datasets and construct models. Are you usually quiet in team settings? Make it a point to give three opinions each meeting.  Make to do lists to keep yourself organized and make sure you don\\'t forget an assignment When a team member (hw or practicum) does something you like/don’t like, immediately  write it down as part of their feedback, it makes giving it later so much easier. Ask for help!  Do NOT be afraid to ask tough questions to the staff/faculty - it will be worth it and it’s probably something people haven’t really thought about Take time over break to relax and spend time with loved ones. Don’t look at who else is interviewing for jobs internally, focus on you Support your teammates and friends when they get a job and they’ll support you Participate whenever you can. You’re in great hands; faculty and staff know what they’re doing so take advantage of every opportunity thrown at you. Go to all the optional lectures and classes if you can, really sit and talk with the coaches, go to office hours if you need to, learn from the communications team, get all the certifications you can, learn from each other, and do the work to the best of your ability. You never know what you’ll learn, you never know what will be useful, and (when it’s all over) you won’t have regrets from not participating and connecting with your classmates.  Be open to who you will get for your practicum sponsor. A smaller company may provide a project that will expose you to more data science work.  In prep for each quiz, start creating a \\'cheat sheet\\' to summarize major concepts. By the time you get to the exam, interviews, or need to reference material, it\\'s all in 1 place and you don\\'t have to dig through lecture videos or slides. The program is hard and intense but you will also meet some of the best/unique people. Don\\'t forget to enjoy it too!  Don\\'t get hung up on grades. Take the time to get to know the IAA faculty. They are some of the most awesome people you will ever meet!  Don\\'t look at networking as simply a way to get a job. You will meet so many alumni and professionals who are happy to speak with you. People love talking about themselves, so striking a good conversation isn\\'t that hard if you\\'re genuinely interested in what they do or how they got there. If someone has an interesting experience or background that you want to learn more about, then just reach out and ask for a phone call or email discussion. Try to have at least a few discussions after info sessions. They are a huge help regardless of whether you pursue a career where that person works! The same applies to our faculty and staff -- just about everyone who comes to the IAA is awesome and you\\'ll have a great time talking to them and learning from them if you make an effort. The first floor bathrooms have a side room in them with showers and an extra sink, mirror, and outlet. You can use this room before info sessions to freshen up hair, makeup, etc. if you want to without dealing with the huge line! Ask for help. You\\'re surrounded by some incredibly smart people, both faculty and students, who want to help you! Take advantage of that. Take advantage of breaks- use the extra time you might have during breaks (between Summer and Fall 1 terms, Thanksgiving break, Winter break) to learn and show off your skills. Study for a certification, complete a small side project, or write a blog post. These things will help set you apart when interviews roll around. At the beginning of the year, place a couple sets of tupperware into your locker. Will come in handy for employer info sessions (and you\\'ll never remember to bring tupperware on the day of!!!) Do things outside of the IAA with your classmates (sports, family dinners, book club, harry potter movie nights).  Create an individual project work portfolio in the spring, especially if you don\\'t have work experience. This showcases your abilities as a data professional better than anything else and gets you noticed by more external companies. Ask the faculty for help when needed especially during the summer practicum as they can offer lots of insight. Focus on the fundamentals and master the foundations and main ideas of each topic Understand that you as a person and your work are two separate things. When you get criticism (which you will) you need to understand that it\\'s your work that\\'s being criticized. Not your character, intellgence, or personality.  The summer practicum project is not the end of the world, don\\'t over stress on it. It is a gateway into how to use analytics in a business setting, you are not expected to know everything! If your practicum sponsor is a place you\\'d like to work after graduation, make an effort to express you are interested in working there after graduation outside of practicum meetings. Something as simple as a quick phone call to learn more about the sponsor\\'s job could help differentiate you (beyond your technical practicum work), especially for very popular companies.  Figure out your support system early! Remind yourself that you are smart, capable, and try to go easy on yourself if it is hard for you to pick up a certain topic or project. Your peers are a valuable resource both for knowledge and for emotional support during the program. Network and stay in touch with companies you are interested in after their information session Get to know your classmates and professors because they are the ones that make this program so enjoyable. There will be very challenging times throughout your 10 months but having support from your classmates and faculty will make it so much better and more manageable! It is okay, even encouraged, to try and then fail. It is not okay to never try. Find a core group of people you relate to and get along with. I found mine through Intramural sports and roommates.  Focus on the programming language(s) that you are weakest in when doing homework Do not compare yourself to other people in the program! This may seem impossible but everyone comes in with different skill sets, experiences, and backgrounds. Focus on making the most of YOUR experience, learning as much as you can, and working hard. Use the resources available! In addition to the course material, books, and faculty, your peers are fantastic sources of knowledge. The Institute brings together students from a diversity of backgrounds, and everyone has something valuable to offer. Don\\'t be afraid to reach out and find those you are comfortable turning to in difficult times. The days are long, but the year is short. Divest yourself of distraction in class. Put the phone down. Have only material on your computer that is for the lecture you are in. Don\\'t work on assignments. There is a wealth of knowledge to gain, but only if you are ready to receive it. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You are not going to know everything or feel like you have a great handle on everything and that is okay. Don\\'t let it wear you down, it will all come with time and effort. Realize that as you go through this program, you are training and working the learning muscle. It will get stronger and faster as each month goes by so stay calm and know that it will continue to get easier to learn and retain as you go. Try not to lose your sense of humor about things. You are going to be tested, even be tempted to go to some dark places throughout this program. Allow yourself to feel it, get through it, and then move on. Take advantage of the on-site counselor as well if you need help at any time. Buy one of the cheap Tableau courses (udemy etc.) prior to the Tableau certification and plan to have everything you want on your resume by December (you will likely begin applying before the new year). I had a fair amount of experience with Tableau and still found these courses to be invaluable in getting certified. Learn to use Git in your practicum.  It will be required in your job. When job season rolls around, let others volunteer to you who they\\'ve heard back from, because asking if people have received an offer or heard news yet puts them in a vulnerable position. Let people share what they are comfortable with.  Take detailed notes in information sessions and reach out on Linkedin / by email to the employers your are really interested in. Utilize the alumni network! The program is not easy, but it does END! Give it your all while you are in it, and it will be 100% worth the hard work. Trust the process, faculty, and your peers. YouTube statquest is your friend If Summer 2 is easy or a review for you, use your downtime to learn more about other programming languages (I recommend Python because it\\'s not used much for instruction in later courses). I promise the course load & difficulty will pick up so taking advantage of the additional time early on will be well worth the effort.  Stop comparing yourself to others. Everyone is here for a reason, and YOUR journey should be your focus. Learn Python Make sure you know how to do each homework and you understand the concepts. They could help you in your practicum project later in the curriculum or help you answer an interview question. You don\\'t have to do everything perfectly in order to grow. Get everything you can to a working state before you try and perfect things.  Take advantage of your DataCamp subscription  Study hard during summer and fall semesters. Those concepts are key and will be asked during interviews.  Each module you will get a lot of feedback from your peers. All of the feedback from previous modules will be available to you throughout the program. In general, the feedback will fluctuate from module to module, but recurring feedback will begin to occur after a few modules. After each module, I recommend that you review all of you previous feedback and identify recurring patterns. This will allow you to identify the things that you need to improve on the most.  Take note in the information session, do not rely on your memory, by the end all will be a blur Have a practicum journal that documents challenges/accomplishments you\\'ve had and contributions you\\'ve made. This is something that could be super helpful that I wish I did. It can help you reflect on things, and being able to talk about your practicum and have stories ready is really important for interviews (and this way you\\'ll have plenty of materials).  Do not worry that you have not mastered each skill/technique, understand the basics and mastery will come. Find your support! Be vulnerable about things that are challenging for you and support others when they are vulnerable with you.  From the beginning type code from scratch for every assignment, rather than copying and pasting from starter/template code helps you recall syntax and better prepare for SAS certifications. Go to social events if you have any desire. Don\\'t just say you\\'ll go to the next one.  Don\\'t be too disappointed if you\\'re not chosen to be a team lead! You\\'ll have more time and energy to learn the material more in-depth. Everyone out of this program will eventually have the opportunity for a formal leadership position after graduation, so don\\'t fret :)  Pace yourself. Even though it\\'s only ten months, the program is a marathon, not a sprint. You\\'ll want to feel energized in the spring when it\\'s time for interviews and the final push for practicum. Work hard, but don\\'t overdo it or you might experience some burn out at the worst possible time.  During interview season support each other through talking and connecting outside of school.  Networking is very important during the job searching process, and it\\'s not that hard. Once you start doing it, it will come more and more natural to you. Don’t get lost in the weeds.  It will get very busy and stressful, so don\\'t forget to make time to hang out with and get to know your classmates. Stress relievers are important too! Networking is very important during the job searching process, and it\\'s not that hard. Once start doing it, it will come more and more natural to you. People will try to debate if Fall 2 or Fall 3 is harder. They\\'re both hard. The thing to remember is that you will get through it and you will come out better because of it. Put effort into researching the companies that you\\'re interviewing with. Interviews will pile up and a lot of students overlook this aspect of the interview process. This will really help you stand out if you\\'re asked what you know about the company or why you want to work there.  Figure out what sets you apart and focus on it when going through the process.  Networking with potential employers after an info session (LinkedIn, setting up phone calls 1-1, etc.) is much more important and impactful than anything that you can do during one. Enjoy yourself during the session and don\\'t worry if you aren\\'t one of the ones who gets to ask a question or hand out their card to six people.  Get the Macadamia Nut flavored syrup at the PCJ down the street- sometimes they give it to you for free since no one ever orders it (and it\\'s good). Socialize with your classmates outside the institute to get to know them better personally. Keep your computer files organized. You will receive a lot of notes, code etc.  The only expectation you should come into this program with is that you are going to work very hard. Otherwise, remain as open as possible to learning new things and taking advantage of incredible opportunities. You may have a particular company in mind right now that you want to pursue; I almost guarantee that you will not end up working there and that is absolutely fine. Leave any preconceived biases about companies, job descriptions, and content at the door and you will surprise yourself.    If you feel like you are the only person that suffers from imposter syndrome, you\\'re in the majority. Just recognize that you CAN get through this with some hard work and help from your classmates.  Get organized and stay organized. There are a lot of due dates and if they aren’t all written down then some will slip through the cracks Put the effort in to make friends! It makes the program a lot more enjoyable. Don\\'t stress too much, it\\'s not as bad as you think it will be You add value.  No matter how intimidated you may feel around your peers, this is an important fact to remember. Try to work Python into your learning experience somehow.  During interview season, sign up for a lot of companies\\' interest lists, even if you\\'re only slightly interested in the company.  You will learn more about the company in an interview than in the information sessions and you may end up realizing you really love the job. Learn Python Finishing an interview with multiple well thought out questions is just as important as how you begin one.  Really do trust the process. You don\\'t need to do more than what is asked of you. Simply do what is asked, do it well, and everything else will fall into place.  Do not put a white cloth napkin in your lap if you are wearing black pants because your pants will turn white.   Be grateful and have fun. The MSA will be stressful at times, but it\\'s a great experience overall. Laugh, make new friends, do activities outside of class, and be thankful for the opportunity. Enjoy the MSA, because it\\'s a wild ride. be direct with feedback instead of only mentioning it in the peer feedback  Stay focused from the beginning. If it feels like you have downtime on the weekend, you should be looking further ahead to get a jumpstart on work coming up. Spend some time over winter break practicing how to explain linear regression to a non-technical audience. A lot of interviewers will have you do this. Save the code and written reports from all of your assignments & spend time after you have turned it in editing it. Some employers will ask for a copy of code or for a writing sample.   Study hard during Summer 2 - it actually counts! Take the time in summer & fall to make friends in the program, it gets much harder as the year goes on and you\\'ll want to leave feeling like you gained good relationships. Keep everything that your team produces, include all code and reports, regardless of your individual contribution. Those will be very resourceful when studying for exams and preparing for interviews. Learn to use Github in homework teams early - not many data science jobs use it yet, but it\\'s good to bring up in your interviews and is just so useful when working on code together in teams Hang out with your classmates as much as possible and get to know them outside of class! You\\'ll all need a break from all the work you have to do! Have fun. You don\\'t have to go home and spend 5 hours doing datacamps every night (a little bit of that is good though) A lot of the tips will say to do a side project, but don\\'t feel pressured to do one just for the sake of doing one. Only do a side project if it\\'s something you\\'re really interested in. Take the time for individual learning of the material. (aka use DataCamp and other online resources) Start learning R, python and SQL as soon as possible and use it for personal projects.  Whenever you feel tempted to park in the visitor spots of the IAA building parking deck, DON\\'T. They are very diligent about towing and it isn\\'t cheap. Learn Tableau as early as possible. Really appreciate the time you get to spend with friends in the Summer/Fall because you\\'ll hardly see each other after Winter Break. You will be surrounded by smartest people making you not smart anymore, that is very good for you to learn from each other. This program can be all encompassing, keep your life in perspective. Find time for yourself and activities you enjoy.  Take care of your mental health throughout the program. This is always true, but especially crucial in a program as stressful as this one. The IAA provides a great resource in Joe Burke\\'s therapy sessions. Take advantage of them! The first two weeks of Fall 1 are crazy. Don\\'t let it scare you, it\\'s not that fast paced all the time.  Try not to focus too much on your grades. Focus more on learning the material, and the grades will take care of themselves. During interviews, use the STAR method. Make goals for yourself on what you want to get out of the program. There are multiple ways to get a lot out of the program (side projects, Data Camp, hack-a-thons, certifications, etc.), so make your goals now and focus on those goals. Otherwise, you will feel bad when others are doing things that you aren\\'t doing. If you have goals and focus on them, you will be more satisfied with your experience at the Institute.  Don\\'t live alone, it gets boring and lonely Do fun stuff with your practicum team (go out for drinks, an escape room, trivia night etc). Make sure to explore the area and all North Carolina has to offer any free chance you can. Use your classmates as resources and offer your help in return! Everyone has a unique background and skill set. What may come naturally to you may be someone\\'s biggest weakness and vice versa! put your name on EVERY job interest list you have even the slightest interest in. Remember you got into this competitive program for a reason - You are qualified and smart enough to get through! Don\\'t stress if you\\'re not the best at any one topic -- everyone here deserves to be here. Be a good team mate! Communicate with your team about what you\\'re working on. Don\\'t wait to ask for help if you\\'re struggling with something. Your classmates will be an important resource for jobs in the future, make a good impression now!   Listen to April!! Especially in the job hunting process. You might think nothing will work out and that you won\\'t get a job but I promise you will!! I went from having nothing in my pipeline to WAY too many job-related things going on. Ask her about it, she\\'ll tell you :) Take initiative in your work - don\\'t just be complacent with the bare minimum or doing just what you\\'re told. Push yourself a step further, and that\\'s how you\\'ll get the most out of the program. East Village Grill is the real MVP if you want cheap but still good. Their Thursday trivia is really difficult but fun. Pace yourself during interview season. It\\'s good to cast a wide net but as the number of interviews pile up, it can be very overwhelming. If you know you want to go in a career in open source, try to do some side project using those tools. Keep sharpening those skills. Learn more Python and R in your free-time (i.e. DataCamp courses). Make friends with people around and be a nice person. Enjoy your time at IAA. Be sure to try a hot dog from the C-Store for lunch. You won’t be disappointed.  Network hard with recruiters before, during, and after the info session. Trust the process, and trust yourself This might seem silly but... pay attention in class, take good notes and ask a lot of questions. It can be hard to focus on days with many classes and toward the end of the year when everyone is thinking about jobs/final practicum presentations. For a lot of exams I would have to go back and re-listen to all the lectures, which was a waste of time and could have been avoided if I payed better attention/took better notes DURING class.  Don\\'t be afraid to ask a ton of questions. Trust the faculty, the process, and all the resources provided for you Learn open source (R, Python) Software If you don\\'t have a coding background do yourself a favor and take 15-30 minutes a day to go through a course on Python. The concepts translate to R, you will have a class in Python, and it will make life easier down the road.  Get the fundamentals down pat. If you are not selected for practicum team lead, do not fret. It is a difficult job and a lot of work in addition to the already heavy work load throughout the semester. Take this as an opportunity to be a great follower and help your fellow teammates. You can find other ways to lead without being the designated leader. You get twice what you put in. Trust in the process, all the faculty staff have been doing this program for 10 years and each year they even do a better job Be comfortable not knowing everything. If you try to do it all/know it all, you\\'ll quickly burn out and be very stressed out. Focus on understanding topics at a high-level and go deeper on the ones you are most interested in. The faculty and staff are an excellent resource. Use them often. Join an IM team! Even if you\\'ve never played sports before. It\\'s a fun way to hang out with classmates outside of the classroom Fall 3 is among the crazier times of the year, but if you have/are an organized homework team lead, you\\'ll be fine Find a mentor. The faculty are always willing to help, but you do have to ask Start assignments early and do everyone you can on your own Always ask questions in class. It\\'s easier to clear it up while you\\'re learning it rather than to try to catch up afterward. If you are feeling comfortable and ahead during the summer and early fall, use that time on get ahead on R and Python. Learning coding languages is mainly on you,  so decide early if you want to get really good at one, and dedicate some time on Data camp to it. Knock out the easy stuff right away. Don\\'t procrastinate and let the small tasks pile up Get involved with other things to take your mind off of school. Fall 2 and Fall 3 are very tough modules between class, practicum, and whatever else you have going on in life so finding that out is important.  Find a buddy and do a side project - the first 2-3 weeks in January are a good time to make a lot of progress and finish something before interviews, but start early in fall. It doesn\\'t matter if the results are amazing, just make an effort to do a project that interests you, and teaches you new things. If you follow through (having a partner helps with this) you\\'ll have something good to talk about in every interview, and it makes a great presentation for the companies that require them in second round interviews. You can also post about it on LinkedIn to show (without any NDA concerns!) what you can do with your skills. Employers see this and they love it. Focus on the concepts and details behind the material, not the specific programming language used. Knowing the math and concepts will allow you to flex to different programming languages. Watch the SAS videos before SAS lectures at the Institute Don\\'t judge a company solely on its information session.  A few companies that gave bad presentations ended up extending some of the best offers.         Get involved in study groups with other students. You can build presentation skills and confidence, as well as get the material down more. Especially if you’re going for SAS certifications, focusing on the goal and building relationships with fellow students will be helpful. Find things to do outside of the Institute and outside of your group of friends at the IAA. It\\'s awesome to have such a great connection with the IAA by being there all day every day, but when you need to unplug that is just as important. Start working on personal projects as early as possible. You will be amazed about how much you will learn by simply making a lot of mistakes. Take primer seriously. It sets the foundation for everything you do, and future you will thank you for having detailed notes to refer to later. Set aside every month to do something fun with your practicum team.  Whether it is bowling, a potluck, or a pub trolley with your team, that time away every month will help you get through the difficult months from November to March. Take notes in ONE NOTE for every single class and every single presentation (with the slides included - you can print them as a PDF into One Note) FROM THE VERY BEGINNING! Trust me, you will love this and appreciate this collection of notes at the end of the program. This is the one of the most helpful and important things you can do overall. The MSA curriculum is intense, but the most important advice I can give you is to be sure you spend time doing things you like to do outside of school. Raleigh has something for everyone. The group fitness classes at State were a great help for me to de-stress, and the instructors became some of my best friends outside of the program. If you go, say hello to Katherine for me! Trust the process. Some of the best interview advice an alum gave me was to \"try to learn something or take something away from every interview\". Even if you feel like you bombed an interview try to find something you can use in future interviews whether it\\'s being more prepared for a certain question or learning something new about analytics that you can incorporate into future answers. Beware of fall 3. Fall 3 = nightmare because of the amount of work and deadlines. Spring 1 = nightmare because of the interviews. Stay calm. Re-read these tips throughout the program if needed. Take deep breaths and pace yourself  The faculty are hard working and highly qualified. Pay attention to what they say and heed their advice about areas where you can improve.  Trust in your classmates, everyone around you is extremely intelligent and you will probably learn something.  Try to get as many certifications as you can while in the program. Plan outings with your homework and practicum teams! Get dinner, do cookouts, whatever. If you\\'re friendly with someone in advance, it makes conflict a lot easier to handle and talk through.  You\\'ll probably see other advise on here that reads like “learn SQL” or “learn Python” or some other technology.  Everything they teach here is useful, but you can\\'t do it all, and learning the technology is only one aspect of being a good data scientist. It might be more realistic to pick 1-3 technologies you didn\\'t know before (including SAS if it\\'s new to you) and really learn them well, and then have a basic understanding of the rest so you can learn on the job if you need to. Work with your team. It will be easier to review homeworks and go over material if you meet with your study group at least once a week. The study groups are  also great for studying for exams. Make sure you do something fun with classmates after the Summer 2 exam, it\\'s a great bonding time.  We went bowling and ate Mexican food :-) If you want to learn more than one programming language be sure to apply it to some of the assignments. This is the best way to learn it! Spend a lot of time getting to know your classmates at the beginning of the program. These opportunities will become more rare as people get busier in the fall. Don\\'t be afraid to ask teachers or fellow classmates questions. You may feel like the only one who doesn\\'t know the answer, but that\\'s never the case.  Take the time to get good at SQL or Dplyr in R quickly (or something where you can handle data manipulation on large sets of data and can automate common operations).  Programming and data manipulation skills are not the focus of your classes (which are primarily on analytic methods), but once you get decent at manipulating data and getting it in the forms you want, it makes everything else more fun and go much smoother. Look forward to making awesome friends. They will be a great help with learning and enjoying the program. Never trust an empty calendar.  When it comes to interview season: trust the process Even if you\\'re not interested in a specific employer, pay attention during information sessions. I found it helpful to gain a wider perspective of how different companies do analytics, and it helped me think through what I want in an employer. Always try to attempt homework assignments when they are first assigned. This prevents rushing at the end when you have more on your plate. During the job search season, my biggest advice is not to compare yourself to others. It is not always going to be obvious to you why employers chose some people over you and it is best not to dwell on it and stay focused on the next interview.  Using Slack is a great communication tool to message all of your peers. I would highly recommend that everyone in your class gets it. Plus you can react to posts through Emojis or even create your own Emoji.  TAKE NETWORKING SERIOUSLY.  It is hard to imagine during all the networking sessions that they have an impact on your job search and interviewing process but it actually does matter.  Network hard if you think you\\'re interested. Start working on homework assignments as soon as they\\'re assigned.  I\\'m a life-long procrastinator, so this was the hardest (yet most valuable) lesson for me to learn in the program. Work can pile up on you rather quickly and if you ever have the opportunity to complete/submit an assignment early, take it!  You\\'ll thank yourself later and save yourself many late nights and stressful deadlines. Do side projects. Kaggle is a great resource for data sets, and there are tons of books that teach R and Python. Udacity, Coursera, etc. are also good resources. Work hard in class, and learn everything they teach you, but the best way to really learn is by doing real world problems. Find a friend who will do a Kaggle project with you, and work once or twice/week on it for several hours. Be open to learning from everyone you meet and work with. There will be people with a lot of experience that you can definitely learn a lot from, but also don\\'t doubt contributions from those coming directly out of undergrad. If you\\'re assigned to a homework lead position, step up and lead. Bring an agenda to meetings. Give direction to the team in the meetings and when wrapping them up. Set internal deadlines for assignments. Be the one who last looks over reports and submits them.  Have an interest in some activity or event?  So does at least one other person in the program.  You\\'ve got so much more in common with your classmates than you think.   PLEASE do not freak out during the interview season. If you do no proceed to the next stage or receive an offer from a company you really like, it is because the position is not a great fit for both parties. It is likely NOT because you are unqualified.  Google calendar is your friend -- create a shared Google calendar for practicum and add all practicum deadlines and meetings there. If you are extremely interested in a certain company that comes by for an information session, make sure you continue to stay in contact with them periodically before they come back for interviews. When it comes to being a good teammate, always ask yourself the question: \"Would our results be the same if everyone else on my team put in the same time and effort as I did?\" If not, you\\'re probably doing it wrong. Take the time to think about how to articulate your ideas before you say them. It will save time later. Take online SQL courses (Udemy, Coursera, DataCamp, etc.) - SQL is a huge skill to have for employers and is useful across industries. Network early and often with employers! Don\\'t be that person who doesn\\'t followup with an employer on LinkedIn and doesn\\'t talk with an employer during an info session. Talk to EVERY employer! Make it a goal to give out at least 1 business card in EVERY employer session.  Stay focused Take advantage of SAS during the program - they seem frustrating (even for open source programmers) but those certificates are costly outside the IAA and show people that you take initiative. Take some time to think about which employers and industries you are most interested in working with in the fall. Making a targeted effort to connect with those employers during information sessions may pay off. Trying to connect with every employer (or no employers) is not a great strategy. Similarly, don\\'t sign up for interviews with employers who you have no interest in working for. Your enthusiasm and engagement during an interview (or lack thereof) is a strong signal to the employer that you have taken the time to think about why you want to work for them.  Form a close network with classmates outside of your team that you lean on for support and talk through similar challenges you go through. Understand that not all team members will contribute equally in work load, just be nice to them. Stay positive! I realize this is only two words and a boring tip, but being positive in group meetings, during class, and when working with others is vital.  Get started on coding language\\'s prior to the program. Getting a certification or at least studying like you are taking one makes the summer session much less stressful and prepares you for the program. Start learning python now, udemy and coursera are great options. Don\\'t try to work on everything. Its not possible. Trust your team members. Only schedule meetings when necessary and make every meeting minute productive. In groups, you will not always agree with your colleagues. Try a method called \"Disagree and commit\"... where you voice that you disagree and think differently, but that you trust your team/teammate to make it happen. Then, you don\\'t drag out your meeting for 3 hrs and can move on quickly. Many times, your team will have it covered, and you will learn something. If not, your team will still appreciate that you trusted them to try out their idea and come back to you to try your idea. Don\\'t start a new Netflix show until after your midpoint presentation.  You won\\'t have time to watch in the fall.   Do your assignments early, do not wait until the last minute! YOU DON\\'T KNOW EVERYTHING. Take the opportunity to learn as much as you can from your peers. You will never be around this many brilliant people ever again in your life If you can\\'t work well with others, you are not going to do well in this program. This is true regardless of how intelligent, experienced, or technically capable you are. People who are unreliable, abrasive, or otherwise bad to work with, develop a reputation quickly. You don\\'t want to be that person.  Try not to get to worked up about the grades.  Study with your peers Study with a friend, or in groups.  Try to complete HW assignments on your own before meeting to discuss with your team members. This will ensure that you know how to do the work on your own. Start on homework assignment and projects as soon as you can. This will help with time management and will allow you to relate lecture material to the assignments. It\\'s important to respect and get along with your practicum team, because you will spend SO much time with them. I love my team, and they all ended up being some of my best friends in the program. I\\'ll continue to talk with them and use them as potential references in future careers. The fact that you work with them so much makes them ideal candidates for references. At the end of each struggle comes a new challenge, so embrace the struggle and trust and enjoy the process.  Trust the process.  If you think you know pressure, you\\'re wrong! There will be a LOT of pressure during the fall. On the positive side, the faculty is very understanding, and is there to help. Trust them, and you will get through it. Enjoy the pain :) Take advantage of every social, professional, and fun opportunity that presents itself. Your time here will fly by. There’s no time to ‘do it later.’ Do it now.  Try to get a jump on learning R or Python on your own time during the summer or early fall time frame. You will only get less motivated and have less time as the year progresses.  Everyone enters the program with a different background. Don\\'t compare yourself or your abilities. Talk to everyone. Learn from everyone.  Your experience here will be unique -- don\\'t compare yourself or your progress to others If you are an international student provide OIS address while filling OPT form. Never provide university residential address as by the time the Employment Card arrives you will have left university residence Apply to jobs online over winter break When looking for jobs, make sure to emphasize the value you would bring to them, not what you\\'ve learned. Everyone will have the same education, so stand out by highlighting what\\'s unique to you or how you will help them.  Everyone here has worked hard and deserves to be here. Value everyone\\'s input and recognize that not everyone took the same path to get here. Appreciate the diversity of experience, thought, and opinion. It\\'s summer. You\\'re about to think you\\'re busy, but you aren\\'t. If you don\\'t already know some open source software and want to learn some during the program-- DO IT NOW. Don\\'t wait. It will be enough to learn the analytics, don\\'t also think you\\'ll have time to pick up a new software package. I recommend Exploratory Data Analysis with R with Udacity. It\\'s incredibly useful and practical and not contingent on you have a good stats. understanding right now.  There are plenty of other fantastic classes out there though, find something exciting and get started. Take several NOW if you\\'re really serious. Do NOT let an employer extend an offer after you have accepted.  Do not eat powdered donuts when you go for sponsor meetings/interviews etc. Set aside some time each week to de-stress, or else you might burn down soon (,which is not cool at all) You will get rejected by lots of companies and it does not feel good. Be prepared for it.  Not getting job offers right away doesn\\'t mean you aren\\'t a great candidate, some companies might be looking for something different than what you have to offer at the moment As you go through the modules, concepts/techniques are repeated so don\\'t panic too much if you don\\'t initially fully understand stuff.  Hang out with classmates outside of school. Take a deep breathe, you are about to have one of the best experiences of your life and you want to be able to take it all in. Keep balance in mind when it comes to school work and make friends. Relying on and learning from the people around you is vital, and you will carry those friendships into your life. You deserve to be a student here, time goes by quick so make the most of it. Trust your teammates Review and watch the lecture videos Pay attention during class. It\\'s pretty easy to get distracted with e-mails, working on homework reports and other things, but in the long run it is much more beneficial to pay attention during class rather than going back later to relearn it. Start writing your practicum report as soon as you start working  Set a great baseline for success in the summer. It will be ok, you were selected for the program, it will all make sense. Take notes electronically so you can search all notes at once, especially advantageous across modules (I used OneNote). You can import the lecture notes and include your personal notes on each page. It\\'s a team based program, but make sure you keep up with your individual work.  If you are going to take Advanced  SAS take it in January. Don\\'t wait until March because there won\\'t be time to study for it in February. The students and the faculty will be much more likely to help you if you\\'re not a jerk.  It\\'s super easy to be a nice person.  Take your peer evaluations seriously! R-E-L-A-X, keep doing your best, and everything\\'s going to work out. You will get stressed about job hunting. Try not to, the system actually works very well!  If you\\'re struggling, recognize you aren\\'t alone - reach out. Utilize your team. Start getting familiar with R and Python now. You get a ton of instruction in SAS, but you don\\'t go as in depth with the open source coding. Embrace the pace! Tell your family and friends you\\'ll see them in December! You can, and you will succeed Review one of the class projects right before the interview season. It will give you more to talk about during your interviews   Apply to positions outside the program Don\\'t expect to be \"forced\" to learn R or Python in the same way that you will learn SAS. If you want those skills, be proactive about it, and try to force yourself to use those tools as often as possible. Study hard for the Base SAS exam. Several students got 68\\'s or 69\\'s when you need a 70 to pass. If you want to learn R, you will need to go out of your way to do so. We had 4 lectures on R, but we were not forced to use it. When you start getting in to the IAA\\'s curriculu, you will realize that there is so much to learn in the field of analytics. Even if you did not need sleep and could stay up 24 hours a day, in 10 months, you won\\'t come close to learning everything. So, try to learn the main topics presented, put in an honest day\\'s work, don\\'t try to stay up all night learning everything, and try to take at least one day off a week, and enjoy the ride. Remember: it\\'s okay to be a part of the second phase.  make sure your computer can connect to an hdmi input. Go out and buy the appropriate dongle if necessary There will be up\\'s and down\\'s during interview season. Stay calm and know that you will end up with an amazing job at the end of the day! Apply to jobs outside of the program. Be sure to exercise throughout the week (with your classmates, if possible). It will help you de-stress and stay focused on your studies. Make sure to take the time during the summer to learn all material in the summer in depth.  It becomes the foundation for a lot of the work you do in the fall semester.  Once you are in the fall semester, catching up becomes a very overwhelming task Work hard on the classes and practicum project Always remain both humble and confident throughout this program. Don\\'t be afraid to befriend the faculty Keep organized notes even if the professors provide great slides -  they are going to be your most valuable resource.  Try to be yourself and not who you think the program/teammates/employers want you to be.  Homework assignments are where the real learning occurs. Do not fall behind.  The pace of the program really does not allow for it.  The only true break you get is over the Christmas holidays and after Fall 3 you will want that time to relax and recharge.  From Summer 2 on, do your best to stay on the learning schedule. Get ready to give this everything you have, it really is as intense as the faculty and staff say it is. Start learning Python now Reach out to employers both after the the information session and a couple weeks before they come to recruit. Don\\'t do it with the intent to get noticed, but with the intent to really understand their organization, the type of work you would be doing, etc. You\\'ll get noticed and you\\'ll have a better idea whether you\\'re actually interested in working for them.  Don\\'t worry about finding a job before January. Focus on learning all the materials. Jobs come very very easily if you can talk about what you learned very well during the interview. Take the time to meet your fellow classmates.  I am leaving this program with so many best friends, and if it wasn\\'t for them, this experience wouldn\\'t have been as enjoyable.   Learn R and Python Rely on your teammates! Don\\'t try to do everything yourself -- there just isn\\'t enough time. If you have a quick task, just go ahead and do it. Immediately. It\\'s okay if you don\\'t have programming experience coming into the program. But try to learn as much as you can during the summer (especially if you are interested in learning R or Python), it will be useful for the fall and for practicum! Remember to clean the kitchen you are expected to maintain an A/B grade point average. Make \"cheat sheets\" to consolidate your notes that you can use to study or for quick references. Coding is a huge part of analytics, so do not rely on others to get coding portions of assignments done. Participate in every aspect of group projects to gain as much experience as you can. When it comes time for interviews, there will be technical coding questions.  If you are coming into the program after having industry experience, believe in the growth of your less-experienced classmates. During the summer session, you will definitely be in teams with at least one classmate with no real-world experience, and it may be frustrating, especially if they are coming in with a lot of false confidence (not knowing what they don\\'t know). Do NOT write off these individuals for the whole program. You have an opportunity to share what you know with them, and you will also have a lot to learn in specific areas you don\\'t expect, whether that is programming a language you haven\\'t learned before or a niche analytics technique. Also, I have seen these same individuals grow immensely throughout the program. It is really awesome to see people improve over time and by the end it really feels they can communicate and work alongside you as a colleague. So early on, be helpful and patient! If you are coming into the program as a student with no real-world experience, be humble and know that there is a lot to still learn outside of the technical, even if you were a total rockstar in undergrad! Don\\'t be shy to ask the faculty, classmates, TAs, or alumnus for help - seriously, people from the IAA are some of the nicest and most helpful people I\\'ve ever met! Also, remember to keep this in mind: \"trust the process.\" The days are long, but the months are short. Being at school from 9 to 4 and then going home, still needing to take care of your other life, and still needing to do school work is tiring. You will fork over so much time to this program. There will be days where you want to throw in the towel and give up. Just keep trudging forward and talk to someone and get help if you need to. Time will start to fly by and before you realize it, you\\'ll be done with the program. You may be skeptical (I was at the start too), but have faith and trust in yourself to get through the program. You\\'ll get out just fine.  Make sure that you always book study rooms ASAP if you need a space for you or your team, especially until the end of Spring 1. After Spring 1, the building isn\\'t as full most days so it\\'s easier to get space.  Broaden your view on the field of analytics. Data science is found in every industry and there\\'s a place for every skill learned during the curriculum. Do some research about which sound interesting and short list 3 to explore more in depth. I could write something generic like \"get to know your classmates,\" but I think it goes much deeper than that. By design, the IAA is a very diverse group of people. This is no accident. You will work closely with personalities that are different from yours, and even more surprising, people who have no interest in wanting to do things the way you want them done. Notice your classmates\\' personalities, and take note of what works and what doesn\\'t work with them. Once you graduate, reflect on the many different types of people you\\'ve worked with and how to handle them, and take the same approach with your coworkers as you start/continue your professional career. Learning to be more emotionally intelligent now will provide you with so many advantages in the future. Some of you will make close friends in the program. Some of you won\\'t. And that\\'s okay. Remember that when you are reading these tips that say you\\'re going to make lifelong friends, the people who wrote them have only known each other for 10 months. They do not know if they will be lifelong friends. Focus on being a good teammate and a kind person, and don\\'t worry about where your relationships with your classmates will be years from now. Make the most of your time in the program. It\\'s only 10 months, but it will feel like 2 years. Make some friends with your classmates and try to get out your comfort zone a little bit. If you are struggling with any content during the program, ask for help! You are surrounding by faculty, staff, and peers that all want to see you succeed. Do not let the fear of being wrong limit your learning. Learn the material, apply your skills, and focus on soaking up the concepts and experience. If you are diligent with your time and have a natural curiosity to learn and further your analytical tool belt, the grades will follow.  Make sure to attempt any analysis homework using both R and Python so you have experience using both programming languages!  Networking is about learning how different industries utilize analytics (e.g., models, programming languages, cloud computing, business context, etc.) and exploring the career paths of others. This will help you identify your own career goals and preferences. Taking notes during AIPs on the company\\'s current goals, challenges, and how you may contribute to it will prove useful for future interviews. Remember, networking is not to land a job through 30-minute coffee chats. \\nWhen the career people say to network early and often, they mean it! Don\\'t wait until January. You will have technical interviews starting in January! Use that free datacamp to add to your analyticall skills. The python certification is straightforward. Don\\'t put it off. Do it in the fall.  \\n Make sure that you are making time for friends inside and outside the Institute. Having a support system that understands you is important.  Trust the process Find a faculty member you connect with and trust. That may be your coach, it may be a technical faculty member, or Dr. West, or Dr. Egan Warren. They\\'re all here to help you and offer advice. Find one who you connect with and lean on them when necessary. While I developed a great relationship with my coach, I also had a candid relationship with Dr. Eagan Warren and found myself seeking her advice quite often as well especially with practicum.  Serenade -- Steve Miller Band (1976)\\n\\nDon\\'t let the stress and anxiety associated with deadlines and deliverables dominate the narrative in your head about the institute and your experience here. Take moments to reflect and enjoy the experience. Connect with your peers and professors.  ALWAYS BYOF (bring your own fork)! Prove this analysis wrong! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322240/ Don\\'t be afraid to try different things in your Practicum project. Often times an interesting idea and different approach can reveal unexpected things about the problem and lead to more insights. Applying different methods of analysis outside your comfort zone is also a great way to learn even more while doing the Practicum! The job search can definitely be an emotionally challenging time. It can be quite difficult observing other people getting interviews for a job that you also applied for. You will hear this A LOT, but you never know the reasons why you were not chosen to proceed with a certain interview or position, and there might be a number of external factors playing into this decision of a company. The most important thing to do is to move on from those experiences quickly and to focus on the next interview in front of you.  Also, remember that AIPs are an opportunity to network, however,  I would recommend also focusing on actually learning about each company, as the AIPs are a great opportunity to learn about the work done at each company, but also things like work-life balance and culture. This program is a great opportunity to develop your time management skills. Use it as an opportunity to get to know more about yourself - what kind of environment do you work best in? How much sleep/rest do you need to be fully or somewhat functional? What is the best way to learn a new subject - studying alone? With others? Knowing how you can be most productive and efficient when you\\'re under time constraints and pressure will be useful in the real world, when you become an analytics professional. The days feel long but the months go by quick! Enjoy the point of the program you are at and don\\'t get too worried about what is to come. Trust the process. If you are struggling with an analytical concept or a homework assignment and aren\\'t making progress figuring it out by yourself, ask for help as soon as possible. You can schedule a meeting time with an instructor or the statistics TA, and they are also available via e-mail or slack. Your classmates are also a good resource for clearing up concepts when instructors are not available. This program moves very quickly, so if you get stuck on something, use every resource possible to clarify it quickly so you don\\'t start falling behind. Take full advantage of all coaching and counseling resources. I have learned as much about myself as I have about analytics in the past 10 months. You\\'re likely to spend a lot of time second-guessing yourself as an IAA student; you might as well learn why you do that in the first place.  Putting in the work and long nights in the summer/fall leads to a much calmer spring. Interview prep will be less stressful if you do the heavy lifting earlier in the year. During December break, I would suggest to focus on learning the concepts from Fall. Lot of interview questions are based on that. Also, study A/B testing as that is a very common interview question. I would prioritize content review and then side project then certifications.  [Fall tip] I\\'m not going to sugarcoat it... Fall was the hardest module for me. The material was tough, and something was due every other day. Fall 1 & 2 focuses on lecture and lecture-based projects, while Fall 3 is preparing for your practicum midpoint review. Manage your time wisely and keep track of deadlines on your google calendar or phone! My practicum team felt we were slower than others but try not to hyper-focus on the comparisons. Just focus on your work, and the faculty will be happy with the effort you\\'ve put in! Contact the faculty if you run into any trouble during the practicum coding! They were the most useful resources! During AIPs, try to network with at least one person and give out your business card whenever you can! Analytics is a way of living. The people you meet in the program will become some of your forever friends, just be willing to invest in them the same way they will invest in you. The personal and professional network will be something that you will continue to use throughout your analytics career. The bestieships you will make at the Institute for Advanced Analitics are some of the most treasured relationships that you will make. Don\\'t underestimate the value of people and their contributions. Before AIPs start, compile a list of to-go questions. Include some specifically for alum and some about the analytics industry. Put in the effort to get to know your teammates. Familiarity takes time, but the sooner you get to know your teammates, the more fun the meetings and the easier the work. Practicum especially. Some of my best friends in the program were my Practicum teammates, and I wish I had put in more effort sooner. Be realistic about your learning. With such an accelerated program, you won\\'t be able to become an expert in these topics. Think of it as building the analytical foundation you\\'ll use as a jumping-off point at the next step in your career.  The career services team is fantastic, and take their advice seriously. When they say \"trust the process\", they\\'ve done the data analysis to back it up. Never hesitate to reach out to Kate and April for advice or just sharing your wins in the job search process - they\\'ll be the happiest to hear about it. Try to use other programming languages to redo your homework assignments or practicum project. Prepare youself be comfortable using both R and Python.  Attend the weekly Improv classes starting in the Fall. At least try it out once. It\\'s an opportunity to practice communication and presenting skills, including spontaneity, creativity, patience, and the all-important skill of keeping your cool when your scene partner says something ridiculous. As you are working on your practicum project it\\'s never a bad idea to ask yourself, \"how would I talk about this in a job interview?\" Fully invest yourself in your practicum project by making sure you understand every aspect of it, even those where you may not be the most active participant. As someone with no prior work experience (fresh out of undergrad), I talked about the practicum an unbelievable amount in job interviews as it basically functions as my entire analytical work experience. The practicum project is a full, industrial scale, end-to-end analytics project experience, so even if you have worked before, it is incredibly valuable for employers to hear about in interviews. As such, make sure your mastery of every part of the project is not just good, but great, detailed, and specific. Everything from the technical methodology, scoping of the problem, communication with client/stakeholders/sponsor, teamwork and leadership, deliverables, etc. will be important talking points in interviews, so lean on the practicum as a tool that you know you can talk about endlessly! Put effort into creating lifelong relationships among classmates and faculty. This includes attending activities with classmates, having a conversation with someone you have talked much, setting up time with faculty for support (P.S. they are amazing), and attending the optional classes/get togethers you are interested in.  As I\\'m sure you know, coding is an incredibly important skill in the job market. Practice over the summer while you still have time. When the fall starts up, try coding your homework assignments yourself, even if other people in your HW team are assigned to do it.  A note for impostor\\'s syndrome: if you made it into the program, that means you already have 90% of what it takes to get your master\\'s degree and a job afterwards.  Use Python regularly. Python appeared most often during my job search. Enjoy yourself and make friends early and often. Once you get back from winter break, everyone will already be in friend groups and it can be hard to branch out then. If it weren\\'t for the great friendships and camaraderie with my teams, the stress would have been overbearing.  Have fun! This program is intense, but it\\'s important to hang out with teammates and take breaks by doing things you love! Have fun! Go to the happy hours, go to lunch with classmates. Build relationships. You\\'re all in this together! Get to know your classmates. Set up social events on the weekends so you can familiarize yourself with everyone in the program, including the opposite cohort! There are a lot of great resources in this program, but two of the absolute gems are Joe and April. Please...and I cannot stress this enough...work with them!! Especially for counseling, at minimum do the intake appointment so that whenever you decide you want to start counseling you are ready to go. Do a lot of informational interviews in the Fall. Not only will it help you land a job, but you will get great advice for getting through the program. Don\\'t be afraid to ask about the things you want to know. Alumni usually love giving advice and giving you information that they wished they knew when they were in your shoes. Once you get your practicum teams in the Fall, someone from each team will have the \"Program Liaison\" role. It may seem like a minor role but the faculty and Dr. Rappa actually really value the input from this role. This person should be an active voice and not afraid to speak up. Listen to your teammates and represent them in the best way possible. Inform your teammates of all the decisions being made to avoid confusion when changes could be made. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for literally anything (the worst they can say is no). Start building relationships with your classmates as soon as you can. Go out on a limb and ask people if they want to hang out, get food/drinks, or play some pickup sports. Think critically about what you want to learn and achieve from this program continuously reevaluate. This will allow you to be more selective in how to budget your time and efforts because it is not sustainable to be a master at everything. \\n\\t\\nSetting goals and calibrating your approach to best achieve your goals will help you both as a student and in the job search. You cannot give maximum effort towards every company, so think about which companies and industries may be more important to you. More targeted Networking will bear more fruit\\n\\t\\nIf you have multiple job offers, think critically about what are your short term, medium term, and long term professional goals are and which opportunity will best help you get there. Salaries will normalize eventually but experiences learned may not. I would say again to use OneNote, but I won\\'t. Learn to work efficiently. If you pay attention during class you won\\'t have to re-watch lecture videos later like everyone else and it will save you a ton of time. You’ll hear it a million times, but trust the process! Put in the work in the summer and fall, and you’ll get where you need to in the spring. This program works, you just have to believe in it (and yourself)! If you\\'re a more technical-minded person, take your non-technical development as seriously as your technical development. Learn from your peers and the faculty (specifically Dr. Egan Warren) about how to become a better presenter, writer, participant in meetings, and interviewee. It\\'s always easy to brush off but try not to.  Don\\'t be afraid to say \"I don\\'t know\". We all start at different points, and it\\'s your job to learn and be the best you can be. Take the actual break during the winter break but start preparing for the interviews. Once you get back from the break, the interviews begin right away, and you might have multiple interviews in one day for different companies. Once you get a list of past behavioral and technical questions from April before the winter break, start writing down your answers to have them ready on time. Also, write notes after every module, maybe even once a week, with the most important concepts to remember. This will come in handy in your preparation for the interviews.  Take out books from the IAA library! They have textbooks with practice problems if you need help solidifying a concept. They also have books that are helpful when determining what you want out of your job search like the defining decade, lean in, and flow. It seems that the Spring 1 module usually goes one of two ways for people. Some see that they don\\'t have classes half of the week and don\\'t take advantage of that extra time, causing them to be more anxious about not having as many interviews or an offer towards the end of the module. Others go for every job opportunity they see, causing them to have 7-10 interviews a week which stresses them out. My point here is that Spring 1 is all about balance, so being able to manage that in a productive way will determine how that module will go for you.  Work as hard as you can to learn python. It will really help when it comes to practicum and interview season Talk to the faculty outside of class. They are very knowledgeable and so willing to help.  Make sure that you actually take meaningful notes during the lectures that you can actually go back to! I can\\'t think of how many times I was preparing for interviews or working on classwork and I would go back to my class notes, only to not quite understand them or find that I\\'d been a bit less diligent. Try to do this even if the class doesn\\'t seem as vital - everything builds on itself, so you never know what you\\'ll need. Developing good time management skills and work-life balance habits early will help you in the long run. Each segment of the program adds a little more work, so being flexible with a refined task management system will help tremendously. Be sure to keep your expectations about free time reasonable, but also remember that this is school and to not let it take over your life. Yes, it should be a priority but not your only one — maintaining your mental health and relationships is just as, if not more important. If you are someone who handwrites notes with a pencil and are comfortable with that, don\\'t feel the need to change. For most of the classes I took handwritten notes and feel like it really helped me reinforce the concepts in my head. Keep all lecture slides so you can study them for technical interviews in February. Set priorities and goals for yourself throughout the modules and year. There is a lot to do and learn with classes, certifications, practicum, and side projects. Prioritizing achievable goals for myself helped me to be able to set some boundaries around school work and feel good about accomplishing my goals without feeling like I had to do it all. Take Summer seriously and use it to structure your schedule, understand how you learn best (rewatching lecture on 2x speed was mine), get in the habit of using your calendar and putting deadlines in your calendar. Take summer seriously.  Our class found it really helpful to have a weekly scheduled trivia night (we highly recommend trivia at Sammy\\'s on Tuesdays). This gave everyone a place to meet up during the week to take a break and to get to know more of our classmates. Focus on your goals and path. You are in a program filled with smart and talented people, and you will be tempted to compare yourselves to others. However, you should make sure you focus on what you want to get out of the program and what your goals are. This helps reduce that fixation with what others are doing and feeling behind. Setting up SMART goals for yourself and planning when you want to get a certification or how many jobs to apply to in a given will help you focus on your path and less so on the path of others. Make an effort to really get to know your classmates at the beginning of the year, particularly in the summer. A lot of the work that you will do at the Institute will be in teams and the work load overall begins to ramp up in the fall, so the summer is the perfect time to go to social events. Doing something fun with your classmates also gives you the opportunity to focus on something outside of work which is usually much needed after demanding ends to each of the modules.  Mr. Mongolian and Gussy\\'s are the best food trucks. Fall 2, Fall 3, and Spring 1 are all difficult but for different reasons. Fall 2 contains a lot of projects and presentations, Fall 3 consists of practicum preparation for midpoint, and Spring 1 is the heat of the job hunt. Although difficult, the difference in challenges make them easier to work through. Start a study group or find a study partner. It\\'ll help you stay dedicated to your studies while offering a distraction when studies inevitably become drab. I highly recommend doing this with someone you enjoy, it makes studying fun! Communicate with your teams, even just to keep them updated about what you’re working on. It’s helpful even if your don’t realize it. The more communication there is, the more comfortable people will feel.  Research financial literacy (maybe kill 2 birds with one stone and do a side project on investing, etc.) so you know what you really need to do for your long-term financial goals. Be vulnerable with your classmates. It helped me so much to hear about how classmates (who I really respect) struggle with anxiety and imposter syndrome just like I did. It is very cathartic to vent with classmates who know exactly what you\\'re going through.  Come to coaching sessions with a game plan of what you what to discuss. Make friends don\\'t go through the program and try to be secluded from everyone. Go to social events whenever possible it makes the program much easier than going through alone. Learn SQL! The institute does a good job introducing it, however if you see the ability to implement it in your practicum or a side project, I would highly recommend. It is so useful for interviews and is just a great tool.  As someone who strives to understand all the details before arriving at the big picture, I struggled at points to grasp some of the statistical/mathematical concepts that are taught here. Looking back, I wish I had stressed about this less - there is simply not the time for it. One thing that can help is studying with others or asking them for help - listening to them explain a concept that is difficult for you to understand may be the missing key after you\\'ve spent hours staring at slides from class. Additionally, if you feel stuck, just try SOMETHING. Especially with coding, a few rounds of trial and error may be all you need. Try to prepare for Spring 1 as much as possible. It is such a busy time with interviewing, and you still have a heavy workload with classes. If you can, try and get ahead with networking prior to this semester. The biggest thing I gained from the program are the friends that I\\'ve made. While studying is important, spend some quality time with the people around you. You will make some life long relationships. Enjoy your time at the institute! It really goes by too fast. Always make time for social events and self care. GET A GOOD NIGHT\\'S SLEEP. Time management is important to be able to juggle all of these things.  Go to office hours. The faculty are super knowledgeable and willing to help you all of the time.  . Be social and hang out with your classmates outside of class. That is the best part of the program! Get your certifications as early as possible. It\\'ll be tempting to say that you\\'ll get your certifications over winter break, but when that time comes you will likely just want to relax. I\\'d recommend finding a friend to line up your certification schedule with so you can hold each other accountable and study together. There\\'s a lot of emphasis put on R throughout most of the homeworks/classes. Try switching it up every now and then and use another software (Python, SAS, etc) to take on assignments because that experience may come in handy for job interviews! Always ask for and be open to feedback. This is your last chance before starting a professional career to get feedback in an educational, low stakes setting. You can use this chance to get an honest assessment of how well you work individually and as a teammate or team lead. Your time at the IAA will come and go faster than you think. You can always go back and re-learn material as necessary, but it\\'s much harder to reach out to people and build relationships after you\\'ve left. Put in the effort and make meaningful relationships with your practicum teammates because those will mean more than any technical material you learn during your time.  Definitely consider knocking out the Python certification in the first half of the fall. It\\'s an excellent crash course in the programming language and is in an easy-to-learn format.  Find at least 1-2 business format outfits that make you feel amazing. Your confidence will shine through during networking and interviews when you feel good about yourself! You\\'ll be assigned to read some books for class, and it is challenging to find the time to give them their due while juggling other assignments. HIGHLY recommend listening to the audiobook versions on 1.5x or 2x speed! Check them out for free on the Libby app (you just need a library card)! You are going to have an amazing year! Don\\'t let the scary tips get you down - it will be a lot of work and growing, but it will absolutely be worth it! The whole process can be quite fun if you foster good relationships with your teammates and the material! Enjoy it! Try to go to as many social events as possible to take care of your mental health Go into interviews prepared. Just some tips on what \"prepared\" looks like - look up the company quarterly reports, is data science an analytics a key piece in their vision for success in the future? Are they investing in RnD or growing their analytics capabilities? Bring these questions to the table or impress your interviewers with this information. Practice with your classmates. Find a group of 3-5 people who you vibe with and practice interview questions a few times a week. This will massively help you prepare for the interview questions and give you confidence. At the end of the day it\\'s just a conversation. Take time to smell the roses Do the work to be here, and treat it like your job. Your peers and the alumni are expecting your very best effort. Go to Cinnaholic in Cary with friends and get any gourmet cinnamon rolls. Do fun things with your practicum group at least once a month. The group will grow closer together and that will help when you inevitably run into problems. Go to office hours! I was someone who never in my entire college career went to office hours, and only halfway through the year did I go the first time and what I was spent trying to figure out for 4 hours in code, the TA solved in under a minute. Definitely check them out if you have any questions or are stuck on anything. Put your ego aside when it comes to teamwork & receiving feedback. Accept it (or not) graciously & keep on doing your best. If you have the space for it, a standing desk and a second monitor can be life changing. Don\\'t feel like you are \"less than\" if you are a less technical member of your practicum or homework teams. Everyone in the program deserves to be here and you likely have a lot of other skills to offer that your more technically experienced classmates may not have Be strategic about who you interview with and what companies you pursue. I came in with the strategy of wanting to reach out to everyone and every company and realized that it wouldn\\'t work.  At times the program will be very tough and push you - you need to embrace those challenging times! Those will be the times when you will learn the most and grow the most. Without challenges there is no growth. Save all code files frequently. SAS Viya crashed multiple times during our virtual Summer 2 lab sessions. If SAS Viya crashes, you can always click “Recover” on the bottom right to recover files. I don\\'t think base SAS has the same option. Be intentional in building relationships in a virtual environment. Don\\'t be afraid to try a virtual party game, to ask a personal question to start every meeting, or ask someone to meet up (virtually or in person). In a virtual environment, you have to intentionally build in time to get to know your teammates and build trust. Though I\\'d also recommend these things in person too! Don\\'t be afraid to reach out to the faculty when you need help with anything. All of the faculty members are amazing and love to help you become as successful as possible. They\\'re all great at answering questions and giving you advise when desired. If you\\'re confused or even stressed, talk to a faculty member. Establish relationships with 1-3 people quickly. Having a go-to person throughout the program to lean on is invaluable.  Be a team player. You will meet some of your life-long friends and future peers here. Really invest a lot of time in creating your internal resume  Start networking now with the intention of building relationships and learning about industries/companies. If you network for the sole purpose of getting a job, you’ll miss out.  Make sure to network a ton with the companies that give AIPs -- this will greatly improve your chance of getting an interview with these companies. Take no weekdays off. If your calendar is free, take the time to get ahead. Things ramp up as each module winds down, so make sure you\\'re taking advantage of open time. It will be really hard and sometimes you\\'ll hate it but once you\\'re done it will absolutely have been worth it.  Start working on the homeworks and projects early.  You might not have the tools to do the whole thing right away, but if you spend even an hour working on the part covered in the day’s class it will be very helpful in the long run. You will probably get rejected by a company for a job you interviewed for. Do not get discouraged, just learn from the experience and be more prepared for the next interview.  Plug into the Raleigh community beyond the IAA.  For me, that looked like joining the Raleigh Catholic Young Adults Facebook page and attending/organizing some events with church friends there, visiting my parents (who live locally), and reconnecting with some old friends who happened to live in the area.  It\\'ll look different for everyone, but having a life outside of the IAA is important to keep from limiting yourself to a \"bubble,\" even though the IAA community is great. Be patient with everyone, including yourself.  Nobody is perfect (peers, staff, faculty, etc.), and kicking someone who\\'s down (again, including yourself) is typically counterproductive.  Brush it off, find something to learn from it, and move on! Engage in the extra events faculty/staff offer, but don\\'t feel guilty if you can\\'t make it to all of them.  Some that I found really interesting this year were Conversation Club and Improv. DON\\'T TRUST AN EMPTY CALENDAR! Side projects are great, especially if you have something you are really interested in. However, it is not something you HAVE to do to be competitive in the job search. The program will take up a vast amount of your time, so if you feel you just can\\'t fit in a side project, don\\'t worry about that hurting your job prospects. It won\\'t. Everyone in the program develops a really valuable skillset that employers want. Trust the IAA, trust the process, and trust yourself! Find a notetaking style that works for you. Some students copy lecture slides into a OneNote document and then annotate them with their notes. Some use good old pen and paper. Others you different methods entirely. Finding a notetaking process that works well to you will make your learning process much smoother. You’re gonna forget things and that’s ok. There’s literally no way to memorize every single thing that’s taught to you, but if you pay attention in class you’ll know where to go to look something up as soon as you need it!\\n Remember that the challenges of the program ebb and flow. Take care of yourself, but dig in and work hard. You\\'ll have long days and weeks, but the program will be over before you know it -- and you\\'ll want to have maximized your experience. While the program is so intense, don\\'t forget to spend time with your family.  They throw a lot at you so give it all you got and roll with the punches! The program is intense, but it\\'s valuable to spend your time on networking and communicating with your classmates.  The nights are long, the year is short. Save all your code, reports, projects, and presentations, regardless of how small they seem. I have gone back to old work countless times throughout this 10-month program and it has helped me refresh myself on old topics and made solving new assignments much less stressful. Start a solid organizational structure that is SEARCHABLE for your notes right from the start in summer (like OneNote or EverNote). You\\'re likely to need concepts from your early notes for classes later in the fall/spring or for practicum! Pro tip: you can download slides from a PDF right into a OneNote so you can make notes on the slides instead of copying the info from them. The earlier on in the program you\\'re able to identify interests/passions, the better time could be divided to achieve those goals. As someone who had no programming experience, 1 year of professional experience, and a non-traditional background, the program is a wealth of knowledge and some of the experiences you choose to be a part of (practicum roles, side projects, certifications, etc.) could affect some of the fit conversations you have with potential employers. Especially if you\\'re newer to stats, programming, technology, etc. being able to tell stories and lessons learned from IAA-specific experiences could be beneficial to the job search. Your success benefits everyone: yourself, your teammates, and the program itself. The faculty will not let you fail, so reach out when you fall behind the program will work with you! You will cover a lot of topics and it\\'s okay if you don\\'t remember every detail. The program is fast paced and intense especially in the fall. Do your best to pick up everything you can, but remember that every topic you cover is probably a topic that some people have spent their life\\'s work on. There is always more to learn! Note the topics you find interesting, and let your curiosity to learn lead you to dive deeper when you have lighter workloads.    Be proactive. Get things done early, have your meetings early, get help early and you will be more confident and create better work. Get to know your practicum teams well at the beginning. It might feel like everyone else is doing data science 24/7. You don\\'t have to be one of these people unless you want to be. It is okay to have other hobbies and passions. You can enjoy data science and excel in this field without spending every waking moment programming.  Always keep the business purpose in mind when doing assignments and practicum work. What business problem are you trying to solve? Who is the customer? What do they need to hear, and how do they need to hear it? That impact-oriented empathy will take you far. Everyone comes from a different background and is at different stages in their career. When job hunting season comes, don’t compare yourself with others. Focus on your own growth and experience. Don’t get too stressed. There will be one offer that is a perfect match for you. Be patient and trust the process. Take some time to do the things you love to do outside of school. The year goes by really quickly and the fall semester is normally the most intensive. Take care of yourself. Read a book, go visit friends, take a trip to the beach when you need it, hike, dance, journal, or whatever it is that you love to do. Mixing your passions with the work from this program is great such as working on a side project, but having some focus outside of analytics will be great for your mental health. Set your priorities and keep to them throughout the program. Just make sure your health and well being are at the top of that list too! Try to coordinate as many student gatherings as possible. The connections and relationships you can develop throughout this program may not be the closest or best ones you ever have, but they will still be fantastic and worth every second. The people you meet will make your experience so much better. The last thing you want to do is look back and wish you would\\'ve spent more time with these people. You\\'re going to learn so much in the program and be exposed to so many new topics and information. There\\'s not enough time to master all of it - instead, take the time to decide what your goals are and what you want to get out of the program. And direct your attention and efforts towards that. If it\\'s machine learning, give that your all; if it\\'s leadership, challenge yourself to be a leader in some way on every team you\\'re a part of. That doesn\\'t mean you won\\'t learn everything else as well, you just might not be an expert in it. The beauty of the program is that you will know enough about a lot of things to be able to refer to resources later on. But choose want you want to get REALLY good at! Always follow the pacing guide if you don\\'t want to miss any assignment, class or quiz Don\\'t be afraid to share screen and live code even if you feel you\\'re the weakest coder in the group. Coding in front of others (even though it felt uncomfortable) taught me so much because you can learn from everyone else on the call! Become comfortable with Python & R in the summer so you can focus on concepts in the fall and spring. Learning machine learning is tough but its tougher to learn machine learning and programming at the same time Practice timed coding challenges BEFORE interview season starts Check both the calendar and the pacing guide. You can set default homepages in your browser that open automatically -- this will help you to not forget the pacing guide when classes are less intense in the spring! When it comes to the job search, EVERYONE can be a connection. I got hired by reaching out to someone I played sports with in high school. Stay organized so your notes are easy to find  Start using Git and implement good documentation practices at the very start of your practicum project. It will make things so much easier when you get to the end and have to deliver everything to your sponsor. Try to organize in person meetups outside that allow you to get to know your classmates better. Some things we did last year included park meetups, hikes, ice-cream, and different outdoor sports As hard as it is, try not to compare yourself, focus on what makes you unique and use it as your secret weapon going into interviews.  It\\'s important to remember that this is a professional program. Remember, your peers and alumni are your future networks so make sure to keep your reputation/brand in mind. Make extra coaching appointments. While you may only be required to do them at certain times, there are no rules that you can\\'t have them more frequently or during a critical period. Come with an agenda - something you want to address, whether it\\'s working better with a teammate, overcoming procrastination tendencies, or general feelings of unworthiness or fear of failure - and really listen to what your coach has to offer. They will help you do your best in the program. It is possible for you to go through this program successfully even without a background in either statistics, computer science or tele-communication/business. Work hard and don\\'t cut corners on your efforts and thoughts, keep things up to date and the rest of your training will be taken care by the faculty and program managers. You can live on the phrase, \"Trust The Process\", from day one.  Try to limit distractions during virtual classes. It is soooo easy to get distracted and being on zoom is exhausting. So anything you can do to reduce distractions is best. You will not be able to learn everything in complete detail, and you will not be expected to. Focus on mastering the basics, especially over the summer. Later, prioritize the subjects you are most interested in.  The program is demanding, especially during the second module of fall semester. I averaged around 65 hours/week that module as a homework team lead, and I easily could have worked more had I not had young kids. However, much of the work is stuff you should want to do. The super-busy times will fly by. This program is over before you know it. Embrace the challenge, and know that the hard parts are very temporary. Make goals for yourself at the beginning of each module based on past feedback; use the coaching sessions to help form and evaluate your goals Grind and push yourself but be sure why you’re doing what you’re doing Create an organizational system and naming convention system for files, especially notes and worksheets if you’re taking notes digitally Take time to write your impressions of the AIPs - it’ll help with IDing which places you’re actually interested in later Practice interview stuff with other students Go outside every day, even if it’s for a walk If classes are online, setup a separate space at your place where you can do your work if you can. Get everything ready and make a checklist of everything you need to do. For example, organize files on your computer, get an external monitor, use your google calendar, have office supplies that you think you’ll need ready, bookmark your online Moodle pages for quick easy access, etc. A lot of good information will be thrown at you and you’ll want to reference that information easily so stay organized. Don’t get behind on organizing your notes and class material, just start disciplining yourself to do it now. There is seriously no competition-- everyone is coming from such different backgrounds and some will obviously know much more than you when you are starting out. Allow yourself to start where you are at and really dig into what you are truly interested in.  Everyone is on their own journey with data science, so just find your own. Use the slower pace at the beginning of each module to get ahead of the game. You will thank yourself later.  Don\\'t be afraid to ask questions. It\\'s a habit that you can reinforce with practice and feel more comfortable about with time. Ask questions in class if you feel comfortable, but especially ask questions with your practicum team and homework teams. Even having one person on a team who asks questions can make a huge impact and make others feel comfortable about asking questions, too. Almost every scenario of 5 people will have someone who seems like they completely understand everything, someone who is fairly lost, and someone who is right in the middle -- so don\\'t feel alone if you don\\'t understand something. The best way for everyone to learn is to feel comfortable admitting these things and then discuss your thoughts. The best part is that it typically helps other people realize things they thought they understood but didn\\'t -- so it helps everyone.  Try planning a weekly get-together with a friend or friends in the program. It will give you something to look forward to and a way to de-stress. Lots of people worked out together or took fitness classes at the gym, which is a lot of fun. You could plan a weekly dinner out to eat or cook together. If you don\\'t have close friends, just ask people in the Slack channel. Especially in the summer and fall, the days are a lot more structured so it\\'s the perfect time to add fun to your routine. Meal prep on the weekends. You likely won\\'t have a lot of time during the fall to cook, so make sure to set aside time to make meals in advance! If there is something that you want to do or a topic that you want to cover that\\'s not in the curriculum, don\\'t hesitate to talk to a staff or faculty member about it. The incredible staff and faculty will do their best to coordinate something or set you up with resources. The beauty of this program is the alumni network. Learn how to network asap and start making meaningful connections. (Don\\'t hit up every alum with the same copy/pasted message) Start learning R and Python on your own in the summer. Do personal projects (either on DataCamp or on your own).  Be a good teammate. The people you meet in this program are important and could one day be the reason you get a job. A good impression is a must. Take care of your mental health and physical health; take time to exercise and relax No one in the program is doing everything right. A majority of your classmates are \"achiever\" types, and tend to go a little crazy when put in a group of 100 other achievers. You are going to have a bad time if you constantly compare yourself to others here. Know what you want, and don\\'t feel pressured to overreach yourself just because everyone else is.  At some point (beginning of the spring semester is a good time), work on a small side project outside of datacamp. It can be a project ranging from a few hours to multiple days, but having experience on something that you work on from start to finish is helpful (and easy) to talk about during interviews. For team leads out there, it really helped me to have a group of my fellow female team leads to talk about struggles and strategies. It was really great for me to have that support network with similar people who were undertaking a like challenge.  This program is meant to challenge you so embrace the struggle!! You can do it, and don\\'t give up! Your best breakthroughs can happen after you take a break and come back to the material or your code.  Don\\'t be afraid to reach out to an employer before they come on campus for interviews Do not be intimidated by learning a new programming language. Everyone had to learn a new language at one point in time so learn what you can and use documentation/advice from classmates to enhance your skills. When a car is on empty you fill it up. Same concept in the program. When you run out of motivation stop working and do something you love.  The faculty are incredible. Get to know them as friends. It makes the process much more enjoyable. Oh yea, trust the process. Legit.  Play intramural sports with your classmates Make time for yourself. This program is very time consuming and if you do not make time to do the things you enjoy, you will not have time. The work will always be there; do not burn yourself out doing work 24/7.  Focus on one thing at a time. Prioritizing is a key to success at the Institute, and while you will have much to do at the same time, taking it one step at a time and putting your all into what is in front of you will help you be more efficient and provide the highest quality work. It will seem overwhelming at times, but this approach will help the demands seem more manageable. Practicum advice: Hard team conversations are just that - hard. However, try to have these as soon as possible when issues come up instead of waiting for wounds to fester. Take the time to decide what it means for you to Trust the Process. For some, that is following without question. For some, that is asking questions to better understand why they should follow. Figure out what it means, then Trust the Process. Know that there are going to be amazing days of progress and very trying days that feel defeating. Don\\'t lose sight of the end goal or why you are doing this in the first place and know that in order to grow, you must first be torn down some. It is a good idea to think through the fall and spring in the summer. Get a handle on life outside of school such as knocking out dentist appointments, car inspections/oil changes, doctor\\'s appointments and other items ahead of time as you will likely not be able to easily schedule these during the fall semester. It doesn\\'t always feel like there are a lot of explicit \"wins\" throughout the program however they are there. Look for them and celebrate them yourself. Remember the questions you were asking just a few weeks ago and compare that to where you are now. Keep a healthy perspective on things. Determine your own organizational system method (I highly highly recommend OneNote from the beginning). The program moves at lightning speed so one key to not falling behind is to be organized. Allow the tools at your disposal to work for you rather than against you. It will be invaluable as you go through the program and you should not waste time fighting your own methods. Work smart, not hard. The best part of the MSA is the people. Attend optional and student led social events (yes, even on zoom) and get to know as many people as you can, they will be your support and you will be theirs.  Be aware of the amount of space you take up when asking questions in information sessions or networking afterwords. Make sure that you don\\'t mansplain or ask a question before someone who has been waiting longer- it\\'s a bad look.  Utilize LinkedIn and the alumni network! Making connections and speaking out during employer information sessions is not the most important, but being active and touching base after absolutely is. Give your 200% for these 10 months. It will be worth it! Get to know your classmates & spend time with them. When things ramp up in Fall 2-3 & then again during the job search in Spring, it\\'s really nice to have close friends to encourage & support you if you\\'re struggling. If you have something in common with people, start a Slack channel & get invested with that group of people. Start a Bible study, an intramural team, a game night, etc. These relationships with people that are going through this same, strange process with you are so important. It can be easy to complain about the things out of your control that you don’t like about the program. Focus on what you can control. Take the soft skill development seriously Do not compare yourself to your peers. Everyone\\'s journey is different and everyone comes into the program with a different background. You are here for a reason :) Team leads don\\'t know everything! They may have been selected to lead a team but they are still going through the same courses and materials as everyone else on the team. Be sure to share your own ideas and inputs and don\\'t be afraid to speak up.  Your classmates are your best resource  Make friends, be proactive and reach out to people to hang out. It is a very intensive and at times stressful program, don\\'t forget that there is life outside of the program. Stay in touch with family, friends, and take care of yourself.  Communication is key. There are going to be times when you get burnt out from the work. That is ok, you need times where you rest to stay effective, but it is important that you make sure your teammates know that so that they can adjust expectations and workload accordingly.  Have fun along the way and enjoy those very special 10 months Take the time to reach out to alums who come to info sessions especially for companies that you\\'re interested in. Whether you get to interview with a company is often associated with if you\\'ve demonstrated interest. Time management is paramount; there are going to be a lot of requirements to manage all at once. Don\\'t compare yourself to others! Your unique path is what brought you to the IAA. Your path through the IAA will be unique to you as well! Skim the slides before the lecture to see what the new terms are and get some sense about it. Then listening in class will be more useful. Become a specialist in either R or Python as quickly as you can -- it\\'ll make your life much easier. If you have little to no programming experience coming in, and if you don\\'t have enough time to study on your own during the summer, don\\'t worry.  Fall 1 and 2 may be little more difficult, but you\\'ll still come out a better programmer either way! Try to take time to take a step back and enjoy the experience. You only do this once, and it will be over before you know it.   Look up Julia it might replace Python.  Enjoy your time in the MSA program with your fellow classmates, time flies faster than you imagine. Be cognizant and aware of analysis paralysis.  If you are still in quarantine, have a routine and stick to it, and don\\'t forget to do some form of exercise every day. Enjoy your time in the MSA program with your fellow classmates, time flies faster than you imagine. Take good notes at every employer session. You will want to refer to them during interview season. There\\'s a common misconception that international students receive significantly fewer interviews (when I joined I heard 2-3 first round interviews). This is not true and as long as you\\'re not super selective, you should have around the median number of first round interviews.  Take time to enjoy yourself and get to know other students in the program. You will ace your interviews as long as you know your practicum project inside and out, make a genuine effort to learn class material, appear to have a life outside of school, and have a number of good questions to ask at the end.  the hotdogs at the c-store are way cheaper than the food trucks Keep in touch with the alumni from the program. Especially the ones from the current batches before you. They can help you get a good referral into the companies you are interested in, particularly for off campus jobs. Take communication training seriously. A big part of analytics is communicating your technical findings in an understandable manner. While there is a ton of work and you can always learn more, take the time to get to know your classmates outside of school. Everyone in the program is really smart and fun to be around. Take a beach weekend, ski trip, Eno quarry day, paintball excursion, or anything that sounds fun. If you put the effort in, you will make several really good friends. Also, never a bad thing to expand your network in the data science field.  Remove the phrase \"I can\\'t\" from your vocabulary when talking about soft and technical skill level. If you do say \"I can\\'t\" in this manner, the word \"yet\" must immediately proceed.  Start a shared folder for the entire class that people can put employer information. There are a lot of employers that come through and you are bound to forget a lot of them. Don\\'t miss out on important life/family events, just communicate with faculty and your teams ahead of time and you will be fine. Work-life balance is more possible than it seems. Don\\'t compare your salary/offers/interviews to everyone else\\'s, it won\\'t change anything. Be open.  Be open to new friends, new ideas, new roles, new geographic areas for work.  Be open to everything! Download the Tapingo app. It\\'s awesome when you want to grab coffee/snacks between classes and because you order in the app you won\\'t have to wait in line. (The Port City Java in Textiles is better than the one in EBII). Learn R and Python.  This will come in handy in the practicum as well as interview season. Learn AWS and Google Cloud Platform Begin getting familiar with Python and R over the summer-- utilize data camp. Have fun! Spend time with the people in the program, it will be amazing how close you are by the end of it. Cherish this time, it goes by fast!  You cannot learn everything! Only dive deep into the topics you are interested in.  Find ways to keep improving. You likely can\\'t specialize in more than 1 or 2 things, but try to be proficient in as many things as possible. start preparing for interviews early, ideally during the christmas break  When you start your practicum it is a lot easier in the long run to work in 2-week sprints, because even if you like to procrastinate you can do that before critical deadlines come up. Define roles on practicum team so there\\'s no confusion about who is responsible for what tasks. Start preparing for technical, behavioral and case questions for interviews at the start of Fall 1. Take a few minutes at the start or end of practicum meetings to practice 1 question. It will lower the stress at the start of Spring. Fall3 isn\\'t that bad - divide and conquer Go into every info session with an open mind and really listen when the people talk about how they feel about their jobs, you can usually tell if they\\'re being genuine or not. Absolutely do the Python Datacamp course during the Summer Don\\'t park in the deck without a parking pass. you WILL be towed. Be open to consulting or industry - a ton of people didn\\'t want to work for an industry like the one they ended up accepting a job in at the start of the program Push yourself to learn all of the material really well even when you\\'re not assigned to a certain project/concept within your team, as this will help you during technical interviews. All of the foundational concepts are taught in the summer and fall semesters. Make sure you have a strong understanding of it. It will be needed for technical interviews with employers and in future work. Get to know the staff and faculty, they are cool people and can help you at the IAA and after. Sharpen your skills in R or Python. Don\\'t be too picky during the job search that you narrow the scope too much, but also there\\'s no need to interview with 30+ companies. Narrow down what you\\'re actually willing to do so you don\\'t burn out or take that opportunity away from a classmate that is genuinely interested in the company.  Don\\'t think you should be complete ready before you start anything. You can always learn it while doing it. Number or type of job offers are not a measurement of your worth or success in this program. Do not be consumed by what other people are doing in the program and simply do your personal best.  Be careful comparing yourself to others in the program. Everyone comes with different motivations for entering the program, and different backgrounds and levels of experience.  Pay attention during class. Most professors provide good slides for studying, but being able to take notes on those slides can be really helpful.  Get in the habit of booking conference rooms multiple days in advance. Once the fall semester hits, they are hard to come by last minute. When you have a presentation interview, make sure that your slides look really good and that you follow the Institute\\'s suggestions on how to structure a presentation. Know how you learn. Are you a visual, audio, or kinesthetic learner? The professors don\\'t teach according to each learning style, so make sure that you know how you learn and the ways to study that are compatible with your learning style.  Don\\'t be shy! Step out of your comfort zone and ask people to hang out outside of school. El Cerro on Avent Fairy has good drink specials everyday! Don\\'t the let the long lines for the professors deter you from stopping by and learning one-on-one! Learn R and Python over the summer! It makes Fall 1 and 2 a lot harder if you\\'re struggling to learn how to code. Keep an open mind at every information session and take LOTS of notes. You may not have too many companies who ask to interview you, so you NEED to make those interviews count and come prepared. Keep an open mind going into the job information sessions. A company you may not seem interested in is actually the perfect fit for you!  Have fun and enjoy the experience! It will fly by in no time, especially the Spring semester! If you\\'re selected as a practicum team lead, set up regular one-on-one\\'s with your teammates, at least once per module. It helped me connect with my team and find out more of the issues that are below the surface and deal with them before they got worse.  You get out what you put in. In addition to the classes and homework, get to know your classmates! Stay after class to work on projects together with your teams, form study groups and work together, attend gym classes together, go to sports events and happy hours and really get to know the people you\\'re in class with! By the fall, you\\'ll be really glad you have a support system to get you through the tough classes and heavy workload. I\\'ve made so many wonderful friends in the program and I can\\'t wait to be out in the workforce working with them! More specific questions yield more helpful information. When you ask for clarification, try to figure out what you don\\'t understand first so that the person answering can better help you. Stolen from a previous year: \"The days are long, but the year is short.\" If time permits, try coding the same thing you did in different coding languages for practice. Intramural sports is a great way to let off some steam and bond with your classmates. The summer is a stressful time, there is lots of material to cover. I highly recommend starting a group-study with a couple of your classmates. It\\'s also a great way to make new friends. It worked for me, it not only helped me succeed in the summer semester, but it also allowed me to make really good friends.  Make good use of your time during interview season. It’s always a good time to learn new stuff when you are not interviewing. Study hard for the end of Summer 2 tests.  The whole process is about personal development, trust the process and make full use of all the resources. Give honest and kind feedback to your teammates and be open-minded to the feedback you receive as well.  Trust the process. Come everyday as a professional and it will reflect come time for job interviews Don\\'t freak out about grades, the institute is there to help, but they do matter. Study up and if you aren\\'t a programmer going in really focus on knowing how to do the analyses in SAS for the end of summer.  Get to know your homework teammates closely and do something outside of the actual assignments to know them as a person Since you cannot use cloud based document editors, like Google Docs, for the practicum,  it can be difficult to work collaboratively on the final report. Instead, use the \"Track Changes\" feature in Word, and there is a way to merge multiple edited Word docs into one document. Also, be sure to take advantage of the automated Table of Contents, List of Figures, and List of Tables features which automatically fills in page numbers based on Heading Styles. Build and maintain rapport if not relationships - old acquaintances can often solve new problems.  The program is very tense & stressful, however time flies and you will finish before even knowing! Always be open to learning from those around you and in groups utilize each person\\'s unique skills. You are not perfect and you cannot do everything. Invest time in getting to know the members of your practicum team outside of regular work hours. Try to get to know people in both cohorts during the summer Networking does matter. Take the time to connect with employers and alumni on LinkedIn and get coffee with individuals you find interesting If you are from a background that is underrepresented in analytics, find role models that will help you through the tough times and seek opportunities to reach out to those who share you background. We can shape this field. Code in multiple languages!  Find people who have different strengths than you and learn from them. Remember to have fun. There is always more work that can be done, you will never do everything perfect. Invest in yourself, get some sleep, do something you love. Set deadlines for assignments a couple days before they are due. Sometimes issues will rear their heads towards the end of assignments. Get to know those around you. The people in your cohort are extremely smart and the analytics community is very small. Who knows, you may end up working with the person next to you LEARN PYTHON. DataCamp is a great resource; learning by doing a side project is even better. Many companies are making the switch to open source, and Python is the fastest-growing language. I got hounded by some employers just because I had shown an early interest in Python. Build relationships with all of your classmates. This is the foundation of your professional network going forward. Take R and Python courses at Udemy, Data Camp... during summer Fall 2 or Fall 3 has the most classwork but job season will be the most stressful semester for most.  The majority of people will end up with jobs they\\'re excited about though so don\\'t stress too much  Trust the process. It will sound like a cliché in a few months, but since you’re in the midst of the learning and changing it can be tough to see your own progress. Consider journaling to plot your growth. Give as much to the IAA as you can! While it\\'s incredibly stressful, it\\'s also one of the most rewarding experiences I\\'ve had. When winter break rolls around, it\\'s incredible to reflect and realize just how much you\\'ve learned in a few short months! Get to know the faculty, make great friends, do side projects and datathons, learn as much as you can! It\\'s an amazing experience. Use the alumni network to your advantage when trying to figure out the different types of jobs are out there. OneNote will be your best friend. Staying organized is key. There is SO much information, you can\\'t possibly remember it all, so having organized notes you can ctrl+f through will be amazing. Do as many of the homework assignments in open source as possible.  If you are not familiar with open source, learn SAS for the concepts and then go to Data Camp to learn more.  This will be an advantage during interviews. Try to get the SAS certifications completed in the fall semester, if possible.  Visit with the faculty and staff frequently. They are all wonderful people with great advice, wisdom, and passion for the program, and they are eager to help you!  Take advantage of Datacamp as early and as much as you can! Follow up with employers on LinkedIn after info sessions if you are interested. There are so many people during networking sessions that it\\'s unlikely for employers to remember you unless you are diligent afterwards as well. Believe in yourself. You will need it to succeed at MSA and beyond. Make some good friends in the program, they keep you going when you can\\'t There is not enough time in the day. Make sure you take time to do something you enjoy in addition to the hours you will spend with your work.  Challenge yourself, you will not truly grow unless you can get out of your comfort zone.  Keep an agenda or calendar and plan backwards from due dates (as a team when possible). Set boundaries with your homework teams early. Plan ahead to avoid meeting on Friday afternoons, weekends, holidays, birthdays, whatever is important to you. It\\'s not necessary 99% of the time! Understand that as people in this program come from different backgrounds, they also have different perspectives about Analytics and where they want to take their careers.  Try to appreciate that and be introspective about what\\'s important to you specifically, although it may be a discovery process as you move through the program. Balance your lifestyle. Not everything is work. It is easy to over work and over study in the program. Allocate time for fun activities in order to relax. You\\'ll feel more motivated and fresh to keep studying. Make time for a break once in a while, so you don\\'t burn out.  We took a camping trip at the beginning of Fall 2 and it was great to set everything down and see a different side of classmates.  It\\'s important to keep work/life balance. Try to work on all the parts of your team\\'s assignments - even if you are not assigned that part. If you are struggling with a concept, ask for help. Both your fellow students and the faculty are great resources, and they\\'d be happy to help you. Build relationships. You\\'ll enjoy the company, you\\'ll have others to reach out to for help, and the process (late Fall) won\\'t be so draining.  Take advantage of lulls in workload by reviewing materials or working on outside projects.  When things pick back-up again you\\'ll realize you wish you had spent that time sharpening your foundational skills. Don\\'t stress. If you need help, ask. Ask friends. Ask faculty. Find activities or hobbies to do outside of the program to give you a good balance. Its nice to step away for awhile.  The fall is really difficult. It is hard to get into the swing of things and manage time with practicum, classes, homework teams, tests, etc. If you fail a test, you are given the opportunity to study more and then retake the exam. They know that there is a lot going on and are always willing to work with you if you put in the effort.  Work through all the homework assignments on your own. You\\'ll need this knowledge at interview time. Pay attention and take notes during class, it helps cut down on the amount of studying you will do outside of class. Recognize that everyone comes from a different (and really cool) background and has something unique to contribute to the team. Listen to others\\' inputs because they are likely something you have never thought of. But also that means that you have something special to contribute, too! So also be confident in your own worth to a team. The program gets really intense. It is important to make sure that you schedule time to do other things besides work.  Additionally, don\\'t judge a book by its cover, if the information session makes the job seem mundane and the one or two employees presenting rub you the wrong way, don\\'t write the company off.  Some of the least exciting information sessions with people I disliked turned out to be some of the jobs I wanted the most after I had interviewed. Don\\'t be afraid to ask for help. Everyone associated with this program wants you to succeed and they\\'re more than willing to help you get to where you want to be.  That said, you have to be willing to meet them halfway by first reaching out. First term is very tough, and fast-paced, but it\\'s totally doable. Work with your teams, try to stay ahead of everything, and if you don\\'t understand something, get help right away. If you feel like you\\'re falling behind, other students, teachers, and books/google can help you catch up quickly. Put the time and effort in, and everything will work out. Do NOT have a dream job or company in mind! I\\'ve learned about so many opportunities in analytics in different industries that I had never thought about before the program. It\\'s easy to spend most of your time in front of a computer at home or in the library. Hold regularly scheduled pick-up games (e.g., soccer at Miller fields, basketball at the gym) or running group meetings to stay active. This is also a great way to get to know people across cohorts. Make sure you really understand/learn what was taught in class every day. Dr. Race will commonly tell you not to leave campus that day until you do understand. That is a great recommendation that will pay off, and will definitely save you from \"re-study\" time during interview season. Push yourself to do homework in programming languages you are less comfortable with, although it takes a bit longer it will help you learn. Challenge yourself to work on pet projects/kaggle competitions with students outside of the MSA curriculum. You might learn additional skills and collaborate with students that you might not get to work with in Practicum/Homework teams. Identify the people in the cohort who are humble and genuinely great leaders. Then emulate them and learn as much as possible from their experiences. Check your ego and ask for help if you need it. Use the coaching sessions to your advantage - come in with a plan of what you want to get accomplished and be open to suggestions and comments from classmates. Be PROACTIVE in the recruiting process. Make a spreadsheet and track your progress to know when you need to reach out to leads again. Don\\'t give up Use each class as a primer for each subject and not an \"end all be all\" to learning - also don\\'t expect to learn everything in every class. Be diligent in note-taking and making review notes. In the interviews, clearly state why you want to work for that particular company- even if they don\\'t ask! Tying this in to your \"tell me about yourself\" introduction is a great strategy. Start with some relevant information about yourself that ultimately leads to the conclusion of why you are sitting in front of them today.  Pay attention in class and re-watch any lectures you did not get the first time around. Learn Proc SQL immediately. Starting as soon as you see this. Network with everyone you can throughout the Fall semester. It\\'ll pay off in the interview process. Do not be afraid to try something new and go in a different direction from your previous background. Groups that split work and have \"final submission\" parties to explain everything that was done to everyone do very well... if you try to do everything yourself, you will be miserable and also make your team miserable. Take advantage of the experience and knowledge your classmates have.  You can learn just as much from them as you do from your instructors.  Take a step back to enjoy yourself, and enjoy the process. Be sure to keep up with friends/family and take the time to do fun things, you\\'ll be happier and more productive in the long run. YOU\\'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS OVERWHELMED. Discuss the issues that are causing you to struggle with your classmates. Chances are they\\'re in the same boat as you. If you find your dream company during an information session, its a good idea to network with them via email, Linkedin, etc. long before interview season begins.  Be careful and professional when you interact with your team members. Addressing things directly is not everyone\\'s preference (even though they might say it is), so brace yourself for hearing your peer feedback during the coaching session. Enjoy the team experience. Do your best but also remember you have a team and be nice to other because this is a tough time for all of us Practice interviewing with as many people in the program as you can, especially people you admire. Try to learn at least one compiled programming language (e.g., Python, JAVA). Many employers are now requiring this as part of their job requirements. Trust and get to know your peers. You\\'ll soon realize you are surrounded by some of the smartest, most hard working, and sincere people you\\'ve ever met. All of the faculty is extremely helpful if you come to them with questions- questions related  to their homework assignments/tests or something completely unrelated to one of their assignments. For example, Dr. Race really helped me out with a PCA project I worked on for a job interview. The faculty is so awesome, and they are always willing to meet with you/help out. Start looking at companies and positions in the fall, this will help you to be prepared come the application and interview season. Breath!!! You are going to get through this. If you feel like you are struggling, try to read through the material before class so that you don\\'t have so many pieces you are trying to piece together.  Be okay with remediation - it\\'s not a bad thing! There are topics that come naturally to some, and not to others - and vice versa. If you have to go through remediation on one or more of the topics, it\\'s actually a good way to solidify some of the concepts! I personally benefited from one of these remediations, and used it for the practicum. Buy your professional clothes early (and on sale). Keep in mind your weight may fluctuate throughout the program so make sure you have breathing room.  Try to get to know everyone in the the program. These will very likely be the people that help you the most later on in your career. And I cannot speak for every class, but we had an awesome group! Your brain will get you from June to December, but your heart will get you from January to graduation. Take care of both all year.  The days are long and the year is short Take care of yourself! It\\'s possible to get sleep and stay healthy throughout the year if you manage your time well. Listen to April when she says networking is important. If you really want that job, show it and take the extra effort to reach out to them. All of my second round interviews were with companies that I networked with.  Practice good work/study/team habits during the summer. It will be to your benefit as you get deep into the fall semester. Your time in the program will pass very quickly and there is very little room to catch up. Make everything you present beautiful for Dr. Healey. Yes, including this tips presentation.  Contribute. Grades, though not very important, reflect peer evaluations. Angry peers lead to bad grades. Pull your weight. Code written in Python for Windows will not behave the same way on Linux Hang out with the people from the institute whenever you can, as you may make some lifelong friends and/or important connections! Fall Module 3 is horrible. Time management and division of labor are key. Please, Please, Please, don\\'t be afraid to ask questions, even if you are only slightly confused or just want to confirm your thinking. Asking a question may open a door to another question or a deeper discussion of a topic. For most people, it\\'s almost impossible to assimilate everything that is taught during the fall semester and that is something you\\'ll need to accept. Don\\'t beat yourself up too much if you\\'re not able to assimilate everything. That being said, do put in your best effort.   Stay current in all your classes, avoid falling behind. Try to start using open source software (R/Python) as early as possible.  Keep your notes get involved Hang out with class mates outside of school and outside of your teams! These people will be great friends and resources after graduation, and it makes the program much more fun to get involved with things outside of class! Save all of your notes on your computer in separate, organized files so they are easy to find later on Focus on specific problems/experiences within teams (especially practicum) to draw on during interview season. Take notes in the code instructors provide rather than alternating between applications.  Then copy the code with you notes into OneNote or Evernote. Ask for help, and ask early (fellow students or professors), there isn\\'t time to waste spending hours on an issue. Take advantage of the office hours to ask questions of the professors. They are more than willing to help you understand the concepts. No question is too trivial. Learn SQL good in the fall. Employers will ask you about SQL, not data steps. Don\\'t stick with what you\\'re comfortable (which will in all likelihood become SAS).  R and Python are great tools that will make you more marketable.  Force yourself to use one of these two languages for an entire module and it will pay off. We work in teams for a reason.  Use your teammates and don\\'t feel the need to do it all on your own. Try to talk to everyone, there are some seriously smart people around. Don\\'t be disappointed if you aren\\'t thrilled about your Practicum Sponsor/project. In the end, you have a valuable real-world learning experience and that\\'s what matters.  Take advantage of summer clothing sales. Business casual five days a week can be rough if you only have one pair of khakis and a couple of polos. Although you\\'re not required to memorize equations.  Doing so will be like have a great friend with you when you\\'re trying to do analytics later in the future Enjoy it, it goes by way too fast! Learn how to use Captions and Cross references in Microsoft Word to automatically keep track of your Figures in your reports Learn how to use OneNote to manage notes You won\\'t remember this tip 8 months from now when it really matters, but the job search comes in at least three waves. Don\\'t panic if things don\\'t really go your way during the first month. It could really come down to the final week or two before the Institute\\'s \"deadline.\" That\\'s in quotes because even if you don\\'t get a job by then, you will get more than your fair share of interviews and offers after that date. Now go on and forget I told you this. April will remind you while you\\'re panicking/whining in her office like I did in February. Don\\'t expect to get to interview with all of the employers that you express interest in. Interview slots are more competitive with the larger class size. Focus on presentations once the analysis for projects is finished. Speak loudly! We had several points docked because one presenting team mate did not project enough to fill the classroom. Try not to get overwhelmed or discouraged by the interview process. It can be a lot, but it is worth it.  the best food trucks come on wednesday Homework from Dr. LaBarr will be hard, but you will learn a TON in the process. Don\\'t feel like you have to get along with everyone and give everyone good evals. Keep your notes organized and in one location. OneNote (part of the Office suite) is a great tool for saving course notes and allows you to add your own notes to them as well. Google Drive or OneDrive are the best resource for team members to simultaneously work on homework assignments. Good organization will make doing any homework/practicum work much more efficient. Support your homework team leads, as the teams are only as good as the group. Learn from your teammates and classmates Really focus on becoming a great analyst to work with on teams. The job placement process is stressful. No matter how much the staff tries to prepare you, it\\'ll still catch you off guard. But don\\'t worry, everyone else feels the same way. You\\'ll make it through!  Getting through Fall 3 is hard, but after that it\\'s smooth sailing. Keep your head up and work together. Balance is a joke, just accept that you have no life now and warn the people currently in your life.  Don\\'t underestimate the SAS certification exams (especially the first one). Pay attention to the early classes, particularly Linear Algebra.  A lot of the later concepts build on the foundation of what you have been exposed to in previous modules.  If your foundation is not solid, you will struggle in subsequent classes. Be patient. Whether it is with team members, faculty, the job search process or anything else in the program, be patient. Dr. Rappa and the rest of the staff really do know what they are doing, trust them and be involved in this experience, and everything will be fantastic. Remember to have fun and enjoy the unique opportunity you\\'ve earned for yourself at the Institute.  Don\\'t put programming languages on your resume that you wouldn\\'t be comfortable working with on the job. Seeing a demo of a language doesn\\'t mean it should go on your resume.  Prioritize the area where you may go. We have a wide coverage on various fields. It is important to concentrate your efforts to dig deeper into some fields where you may be working in. When it comes to getting a job, things most likely will not turn out as originally planned.  That being said, everything will come together and work out better than you  even expected.  Don\\'t stress out, enjoys the process, and know that everything will come together. Trust your teammates Try not to stress out too much about the exams. There are only a  few after the summer Summer 2, and they are not as difficult as you might expect. Keep a to-do list (like a virtual note on your desktop). You\\'re going to have so many resources in the program, take advantage of this! start the data visualization project way earlier than you think. in fact, start everything in Fall 2 as soon as you get it so you dont fall behind Fall 2 is the most stressful, fast-paced semester. Get ready for this. It gets easier from there. Depending on your cohort, you may or may not make those amazing friends you might hear about in other TIPs. If you find your besties in the program, amazing! If you find a lot of connections and future analytical colleagues, also amazing!  Hang out with your classmates during lunch or class break. You will make some awesome new friends who you can learn from and grow together! Give everything your best. Do anything and everything you can to do well. You will fail, but that\\'s okay. Learn from it and grow. At the start of the program, I thought I would never do well and that I would be way in over my head. For the first few weeks, I felt like that. As time went on, I found what my strengths were and always brought those to the table to contribute. From there, I could focus on what I was weak on to make myself a well-rounded data scientist. You are more analytically minded than you give yourself credit for. It\\'s unlikely you will feel comfortable with the whole curriculum and that\\'s okay! Seek third party feedback and utilize provided coaching, counseling, and career development resources to define your own meaning of success and happiness. The practicum project is an incredible experience, but knowing that you have to spend the next eight months closely working with the same people on a unique project can be daunting. I remember dreading the conflict that would inevitably arise when my team was first assigned. I was right; there was definitely healthy conflict over the course of our project. However, as long as the conflict is for the group\\'s benefit, situations like these tend to blow over very quickly. There was once in particular when I was afraid a certain situation would derail our progress, but surprisingly, it worked itself out very quickly after openly communicating with each other. Whenever conflict arises, be sure to 1) see the situation for what it is, 2) openly and honestly communicate with each other, and most importantly, 3) MOVE ON. Nothing in this program is worth holding a grudge over. Learn SQL. Most of our technical interviews involved SQL this year.  Be sure to build connections with your classmates early and often. You are surrounding by great people who are all learning the same things you are. These are the people you will be able to lean on for support. Stop stressing in general. You\\'re all smart and capable, you wouldn\\'t be in the room otherwise. You\\'re going to be fine. It will likely be overwhelming and tiring sometimes, but so is life, what\\'s new? It will be over before you know it, so do yourself a favor and just relax.  Make sure to spend time with your friends, family, and classmates outside of the institute! Maintaining these relationships will keep you sane! Be confident but humble. You are here because you have something valuable to bring to the table, just like everyone else. Don\\'t compare yourself with others, but be aware of your strengths and weaknesses that you may discover through teamwork, and learn how to improve them from your teammates. Improving my self-awareness was the most valuable thing I gained during my time in the IAA. You will feel busy. Be busier and redo some of your analysis assignments in Python and make a github of your work. When someone asks for code samples, you will be ready. Work on being a better team member every week. Listen actively. Plan ahead. Use your calendar and look at the calendars of others. Schedule your personal time (e.g. gym) when it is least likely to impact team work especially if you have commuters or people with children on your team.  Combat your monachopsis by upskilling and being a kind and talented contributor to your groups. \\n Make review sheets for each class. It will be important when you start reviewing concepts for technical interviews. The greek foodtruck is the best!  If you\\'re interested in doing a side project, do it in the Fall. If you\\'re planning on getting certifications, finish them by January. In the Spring, you become very busy with juggling interviews, practicum, and class work. You won\\'t have time for much else on your plate. And once you have a job secured, it becomes a race to graduation. Sharp Dressed Man -- ZZ Top (1983)\\n\\nYou might want an extra set of business formal clothes. During portions of the fall semester I was wearing the same suit very often, up to 3-4 times in a week. Maybe just an extra pair of pants to go with the same jacket.  Be wise about managing your time. Analyze what time you have available, what tasks you need to complete, when tasks are due, and aggressively pace yourself. DO NOT GET BEHIND.  Make sure to keep up with your schedule for interviews, practicum and homework team work, classes, and some social time as well during the Spring. Keep your calendar updated, with study blocks or work sessions too if that helps you, and stick to it. Your teammates will thank you, and you will be better prepared for interviews when you have a plan for what is coming! Enjoy the summer and use your free time early on to form relationships with your peers in the program. Also, don\\'t stress out too much about this TIPS assignment. It\\'s just an opportunity to get comfortable working together and starting to analyze data.  Trust the process. Focus on the growth mindset. Utilize coaching as much as you can! Reach out to your peers and faculty when you are struggling. Realizing that you need help, and asking for help will be a valuable skill when you become an analytics professional. Expand your analytical skillset as much as possible. Although it may feel uncomfortable, take advantage of the program\\'s resources and faculty to try out a new language/skill. You will thank yourself during interview season when you feel confident talking about a diverse resume.  Enjoy, and don\\'t take everything hard on yourself. Everyone is different. Start reaching out to alumni for informational interviews in the fall! The internal and external job search process in spring ramps up very quickly, and it may become difficult to make time for informal meetings on top of applying for jobs, prepping for interviews, and completing class assignments. Try to make a note of what companies you are most interested in and reach out to alumni working there. Be sure to ask what kinds of skills make a good candidate for that particular company or industry, this is super helpful information to have when preparing for interviews! This year, the general consensus of my peers was that Spring 1 was by far the most stressful semester. April often asserts, \"getting a job is a job.\" I\\'d take that further and say, \"getting a job is a really hard and emotionally defeating job.\" Try to be particularly mindful of any mood or attitude changes that you experience during the job hunt. There\\'s a lot of jealousy, embarrassment, and guilt that goes around. Be honest with yourself and your coach, counselor, and friends outside of the Institute about how you\\'re feeling. Then, when you\\'re ready, get back on track and secure that bag!  Make friends through the whole process! Some of my closest friends I didn\\'t make until Spring 2. Lean on people who are going through the program with you, or even alumni who have made it through to the other side! Take the time to bond with your practicum teammates early, and the rest of the project will go much more smoothly. [Spring tip] Spring will feel significantly different after the beast that is the Fall module. Lectures will be more spread apart, as well as deadlines. Friends, don\\'t let friends forget about quizzes! We had many students slack in the general chat when something was due, which was a great reminder. The end of January through the first week of March will be interview season. Pay attention during all of Kate & April\\'s career classes. You\\'ll feel like you\\'re competing with all your classmates to get jobs but don\\'t get upset if you\\'re not given an offer. The recruiting process can be complicated, and someone may get chosen because they seem like a better fit. Don\\'t take this personally - the program has prepared you to be a strong candidate everywhere you go, and you will be the right fit for another company. Look for jobs externally, along with your internal interviews!  Everyone will talk about how hard Fall 2 is, but be prepared for how mentally draining Spring 1 will be. You will have a lot more free (unscheduled) time, but you will need to manage it wisely with everything going on. You\\'ll quickly realize that the \"free\" time you thought you had will be spent grinding on practicum or trying to find a job. Take heart and trust the process. When prepping for interviews, review previous homework reports as a refresher of the material. Take advantage of Carmichael Gym, you guys will all have free access to it throughout the year. It has everything you could need: plenty of weights, treadmills, basketball courts, swimming pools, tennis courts, pickelball, raquetball, a climbing wall, a sauna, steam room, showers, etc. You can park in most places on main campus before 7am or after 5pm during weekdays. On weekends parking is pretty much free everywhere. Go to sporting events, you guys will get free tickets to everything as students. Also sign up for intramural sports, they have almost every sport you could imagine and you can join or form teams and compete against other students. Meal prep/pack lunches. It is so easy to leave for school in the morning and plan on buying food at lunch, but this adds up fast in cost. Buy tupperware and a lunch bag. It is well worth the investment in the long run as the food trucks are expensive and often there are meetings during lunch time! Build pockets of fun wherever you can. Choose an exciting side project or subject for the text analytics project. Go to Brandon\\'s game nights. Do the intramural sports teams (even if you\\'re not \"good\"). Bring a ball to toss around outside during breaks with other students. Take a weekend trip. Enjoy yourself!  If you\\'re an international student, make the most of what your classmates have to offer. You\\'ll be surrounded by some of the brightest minds around, so learn from them and share what you\\'ve learned in the past - collaboration over competition always helps. Lastly, find a buddy (or two) in the program who\\'ll be with you through thick and thin. Build a couple friendships in class that you\\'ll cherish for the rest of your life.  Take everything seriously but don’t kill yourself with all the work and everything. Enjoy the process and enjoy the time work with your classmates.  Trust the process overall, but make sure to pursue external job leads and find your favorite area to contribute in group work and make that known in interviews. If you are really good at presenting technical information in an understandable way try to find clever ways to bring that up in interviews and showcase your strengths. Become friends with the people on your Practicum team. At least get to know who they are outside of an academic and professional setting. This might look like doing things as a group outside of classes and meetings, such as going for a walk around campus between classes or getting together at someone\\'s house for dinner. You\\'ll work together more effectively if you\\'ve made the effort to become acquainted and you actually like your teammates. Listen to the staff and faculty. When faculty give you feedback on your practicum deliverables listen to them. When April and Kate tell you to do something listen to them. They are the experts and they really do have your best interests at heart. Develop relationships with your classmates. The program is intensive and difficult, but you will have an entire body of students going through it alongside you. Developing personal relationships with your classmates will make the experience much more enjoyable. For me, I was very close with my practicum teammates and some others, and just having people to joke around with, bounce ideas off of, go out and decompress with, etc. was really valuable. Get work done early and establish an organization system. The institute does a great job setting you up with a few tools to keep you on track such as moodle and google calendar. However, you need to plan your days and weeks well to make the most out of the limited time you have. I would also recommend taking good notes during the year that you can reference for tests, job interviews, and ultimately your job. Don\\'t hesitate to re-watch the lectures. If you missed class or just want to get a refresher on some of the analytics concepts, utilize the Panopto recordings! I and many of my classmates found it to be really beneficial to re-watch the lectures soon and well in advance of any exams/presentations. Engage with as many people as you can. Not just classmates, but faculty, staff, TAs, alumni, etc... this is one of the best environments for professional networking, by design. Networking is not as fake and gross as you expect. Most conversations surprised me with how genuine they were. It also will make you much more comfortable during interviews. Lastly, do make time to see friends and family outside of the program. Sometimes its good to get a break from the IAA stress bubble to recenter your perspective and relax more. Everyone at the IAA is always going to be talking about HW, side projects, certs, or jobs and it can add to your stress at times. If you feel that, it\\'s time to see the world outside of the IAA a bit! Learn Python early and get a lot of practice in it throughout the year. This will help when interview season comes. You cannot approach this program the same way that you approached your undergraduate degree. It is a new experience and it will take some adjusting to. Build a community of friends. I saw this one a lot when I was reading the tips and didn\\'t really understand what it meant until I went through the program. This program is hard and its only harder if you try to do it on your own. Your friends are yes, social and emotional support, but in this program working with friends will make you a better student. The truth is you don\\'t know everything (sorry) and you will benefit from working with people that have different strengths and skillsets. It is so much easier to thrive in this program when you have a group of friends to study with, work on homework assignments together, and practice interviewing with. Focus on learning, NOT grades. Your success is determined by how much you learn and your ability to apply the skills you learn. There is enough stress in the program. Worrying about grades is not helpful. The IAA staff and faculty are truly here to support you -- everyone genuinely wants you to succeed. Reach out if you are struggling, stressed, or want some guidance. April and Kate (professional services) are gems. Reach out to them with any concerns. The job search can be stressful (and emotional) -- comparing yourself to others won\\'t serve you! Focus on being the best you can be, and MAKE the time to rest and recharge during the job search. Make the job search process your own and don\\'t be afraid to be unorthodox, cast a wide net, and reach out to external companies. Tune out all the noise, and what other people are doing and what offers they are getting. Focus on yourself and your goals. Don\\'t be afraid to start researching and applying early and do what is best for you. Use OneNote. Also, try to do some assignments (or at least a side project) in python. Many companies use python not R, so you\\'ll be more prepared once you go into the workforce. This is probably all over TIPS, but the people in this program are some of the best you’ll ever meet. I have made some of my best friends here, so much so that I’ll be living with some of them after graduation. This isn’t your typical grad program where everyone’s cooped up all day— we all work hard, but know our limits and how to have fun! From our class’ epic Halloween party to Tuesday trivia takeovers at Sammy’s to our post-graduation class beach trip, we’ve made some great memories and I know this upcoming class will too!  Give yourself time to relax and have fun on the weekends! Try to get to know your classmates, everyone I\\'ve met is genuinely a good person, and many of them have diverse and interesting backgrounds! Time flies in this program, so make sure to get the best of it in terms of learning, practicing your soft skills, preparing for real-world and cultural differences in the work environment, and making friendships. Have one non negotiable on your calendar that brings you pure happiness. For me, that was having friends over to watch The Bachelor every Monday from 8-10. Having something to look forward to each week was very impactful.  Don\\'t underestimate the power of networking. When you are a practicum or homework team lead, get in the habit of over-communicating. It\\'s always better to promote and reach clarity about who is doing what, what needs to get done, etc., especially if you\\'re in a remote setting. Lean on your support system outside of school if you can! This was super important to me personally as an underrepresented minority student - having my friends and family who know me and my values and goals to ground me throughout the process helped me gain perspective whenever I felt overwhelmed. At some point you might get this big-brother feeling that the faculty are watching your every move. It is because they are. Use it to your advantage and show them that you are here to learn and make the most out of your time. They will reciprocate that effort.  You don\\'t need to do everything all the time. When the year gets really busy it feels like there\\'s always more you could be doing whether that be reaching out to alumni, interview practice, or studying for a certification. Also when you look at your classmates you will probably always see someone who is doing more than you. But don\\'t try to do everything or you will burn yourself out. I recommend setting attainable goals for the week and making sure you don\\'t spread yourself too thin. Take advantage of the resources at the IAA! The coaching, counseling, faculty guidance, and technical resources you get at the IAA are tremendous, and you have them at your disposal. Use these resources to help develop your technical and soft skills and maintain your mental well-being. The IAA is a community that you remain a part of once you graduate, but you should take advantage of the resources provided while you are there.  Make friends, trust the process, and enjoy the 10 months. The days can go by slow but the year is fast. Before you know it, you will be filling out a TIPS Google form for the next class! People in this program are very like-minded. That means it is really easy to find people who think like you and like the things you like. Sports people, video gamers, foodies, outdoorsy types, the IAA has them all. Start a #social channel in Slack and start planning things! Greet people as they walk past in the hallways or in class, even if you don’t normally talk with them.  Don\\'t neglect balancing your speaking and writing skills. Oral presentations are typically more intimidating for most people and so are worked on more frequently, but be sure to keep your writing at the same level. Come interview season, prepare to talk about what’s on your resume at length and tailor your answers to show tour technical skill. More importantly, show your personality. Anyone interviewing through the institute knows the students are skilled. Companies are looking more so at who they could see fitting on their team.  Don\\'t get too stressed about this TIPS project. It just is setting the tone for presenting the analytical work going forward. It\\'s not meant to be perfect! Create a personal system to keep track of deadlines for assignments, quizzes, etc. Whether that\\'s using a calendar/calendar blocking, a task tracker, or something else, I found it very helpful to be able to look ahead to the next few weeks and understand how I was going to have to manage my time to get all of the work done. While a lot of the work is individual in the summer, this is complicated by the fact that so much of what you\\'ll be working on in the fall is teamwork. Sometimes it was impossible to work ahead, but knowledge is power. Also pro tip - friends don\\'t let friends forget their quizzes! It is totally normal to feel stressed and anxious throughout this program, especially at the start as you are adjusting to the pace and rigor. Just know that you will learn to adapt each time you overcome a new challenge and will come out a lot more confident on the other side. Be confident during interview season. You won\\'t get every job you apply for, but that\\'s totally fine and completely normal. One of the most important parts of getting a job is fitting the vibe of the company, so make sure to be positive during your interviews.  Don\\'t be afraid to speak up during team discussions. You would be surprised by how much direction you can give your team just by sharing your thoughts! Remember to take some time to relax and destress. Your brain will need it. Get sleep, eat yummy food, exercise or go out for a walk. Hang out with your friends and family. Nothing is worth losing your physical or mental health over. Although networking may seem like an extremely daunting task, if you start networking in the Fall it will pay dividends if you reconnect with those people come the job search. All you have to do is ask if people are available for a 30 minute chat to discuss their company, position, and background. Then reconnect in the Spring to ask how they\\'ve been, about their current projects, and if they are aware of any open positions. There is a vast alumni network and all alumni are more than happy to talk with current students. Networking is difficult, hard, and uncomfortable, but its an extremely important aspect of this profession that everyone is more than capable of doing.  Take walks between classes when you can! Getting outside during long days was essential. Don\\'t be afraid to apply for your dream job! While it\\'s good to make sure you have options, don\\'t shy away from putting yourself out there and working hard for an opportunity that would make you really happy. If you\\'re new to coding, I recommend taking time on the weekends to practice. I specifically took time to practice writing loops in Python and R, which served me well later in the program! And try not to compare yourself to others\\' coding skills. There are PLENTY of people who entered this program as coding novices and successfully completed it! You will become a much more confident coder due to practicing and not shying away from the coding aspects of data science. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of bonding with your teammates and classmates in general. Our year did a ton of Raleigh Beer Garden casual meet ups and things like this and I really recommend suggesting large group activities where everyone can chat and get to know one another. You are all in it together! It is going to be an amazing year, embrace the process and really give it your all and you will reap amazing benefits!  Don\\'t forget to take Dr. L\\'s quizzes! Relax and \"trust the process.\" Good luck. 😅 Go to Moge Tee on Hillsborough St with friends for bubble/boba tea. Use the IAA\\'s resources. Talk to your professors and ask them for help. Use the coaching sessions and mental health counseling. If you\\'re struggling with interviews ask April and/or Kate for more practice! Practice with Python and R the most you can. Best way to do this isn\\'t necesarily a side project, just think of something fun like a poker simulator or roulette sim to find the best strategy and try to see it through. It gives you the most experience to get comfortable with the basics, and its fun to do. Take things seriously from the very beginning and you\\'ll hit your stride.  Use all of the coding resources in the summer, especially if you\\'re new to coding and take good notes. I referenced my notes from the SAS e-learnings and the R and Python Data Camp courses all the time. You can also continue to use data camp to learn things you may need for your practicum that weren\\'t discussed in class. Don\\'t let the feedback forms at the end of each module be the only way you give feedback to your teammates. Your teammates are not mind readers and will likely benefit much more from an open conversation about the ways the team or the team member can be more effective. Conversations about feedback allow the other person to ask questions about what an improvement might look like as well as understand more specific instances of the feedback in question. These conversations might feel uncomfortable but if you come from a place of respect and vulnerability your teammates will thank you! You will be exposed and made aware of plenty of resources but it is up to YOU to utilize them. One of the most valuable resources you will have is the alumni network. Reach out to people and connect even if you only get a response from 1/10 alumni, that 1 might be enough to get you a job. Talk to the professors, you can learn a lot from them and their experiences. If your job hunt is stalling or you\\'re not feeling too good about it, reach out to April. It is on you to utilize every tool that you have especially in an online setting where it is easy to feel disconnected.  Focus on understanding each aspect of the curriculum and taking good notes! These will be invaluable when you start your next job. Reach out to people and make friends early on so you have a group of friends you can count on since the beginning especially if you live alone. This can be your summer practicum group or classmates you interact with often on Slack. You need interaction especially when we are all virtual. If you haven’t found your group yet, it is never too late! Everyone is friendly and nice. Reach out to the faculty. They want to help you, they want to help you think through challenging topics in data science, and they love what they do. They can give you advice on balancing life and career, talk with you about issues you see in data science, and how to work with sponsors and teammates. Make sure to communicate with your teammates. It\\'s especially important when everything is virtual because your teammates can\\'t see what you\\'re doing. Take your work seriously, but keep the end goal in mind. Learning. Do assignments in the way that best helps prepare you for what you want to me.  Really, don\\'t worry about your grades. Just focus on learning. Work closely with your Practicum team for homework, and interview practice.  Network!!! Your “MS Candidate in Analytics ...” LinkedIn title is a free pass to talk to so many successful alumni. Use it. The worst that can happen is they ignore it and it’s like you never reached out. The practicum project was a sandbox for me -- I made mistakes in a no-stakes environment, and I learned from these mistakes. I\\'ll take these lessons learned with me into my career and perform better as a result. So I encourage you to make mistakes here, and most importantly, learn from them. Take weekends off. Your weeks will be busy, so make sure you are taking time to relax and unwind. You will burn out if you don\\'t.  If you\\'re struggling with something (an assignment, a concept) chances are 90-95% of the class is too. But the good news is that you can find one of the 5-10% of students that have prior knowledge and aren\\'t struggling to offer help on how to complete an assignment or explain concepts to you in a way that you\\'ll understand  This one is not just for the IAA, but for job searches in general.  Try not to take the process personally.  You will have great conversations with people who end up not wanting to move forward, and then feel like you bombed conversations where they actually loved you.  You will never know exactly what is going on in their head, and what they need for the role.  \\n\\nTherefore, just do your best to prepare for each interview, and give it your all.  Then forget about it once you are done, and have sent your thank you emails.  Clearing your mind will allow you to do the best in the next one, and it will all work out in the end.  Build good and genuine relationships with faculty and staff.  They\\'re all worth getting to genuinely know, and they all have tremendous knowledge and experience to share with you. Take the nontechnical portions of the program seriously.  It\\'s tempting to focus solely on the math and programming, but doing so at the expense of your soft skills will leave you unrounded and struggling in interviews.  The good news is that the faculty/staff offer terrific information and support to help you build those soft skills! Find out how you learn best, and then do that. I\\'m an oddball who learns best by systematically reading through written materials (generally better for me than live lectures), so I relied a lot on going through slide decks/notes and compiling personal study guides before quizzes/tests. Alternatively, one of my peers re-watched lectures all the time. Each of us would have found the other\\'s method of review not too helpful, and that\\'s the point - you need to learn how you learn so that you can dedicate your time and energy toward absorbing and retaining the material. There is only so much you can control when it comes to your job search. However, one thing that is completely in your control is networking. The IAA has a vast alumni network, and alumni of the program are incredibly generous with their time. They\\'ve all been through the job search process, and they want to help you as much as they can. Reach out to a lot of alumni, both at companies you think you are interested in and one\\'s you don\\'t think you are interested in. Hearing from them about their experiences can help you get a more solid understanding of what types of jobs in analytics interest you the most. It can also give you concrete examples to provide in interviews and cover letters for companies that those alumni work for. If you are down about not having any interviews lined up, reach out to a bunch of alumni and fill up some of your calendar with Zoom chats. Also, check in with career services! April\\'s amazing and she\\'ll always level with you about what you can do to improve your search. Remember to take care of yourself! You learn a ton in the 10 months of the program, but cramming that much material into a relatively short period of time means that you are going to stretched to your limit at times. Make sure that you continue to take the time to do the things you enjoy, eat well, and maintain your physical health. The program is a marathon, not a sprint. Try to bring yourself to go to at least a couple social hangouts, even if large groups aren’t your thing. Even being remote, the friendships you make in the program can make your work and meetings so much more enjoyable. Set up weekly meet-ups if that’s your thing, or go play some tennis or disc golf or anything else. It’s fun to commiserate with other people who are in your exact same shoes while doing something fun. Be professional and take coaching sessions and communication training seriously. Your professionalism and ability to communicate will set you apart during the interview process and will help you establish positive relationships with your peers and the IAA faculty and staff.  NEVER be afraid to ask faculty questions, they are so willing to help! Make sure to connect with your teammates and be there for them! During the interview process, people will say \"Be yourself\". I didn\\'t understand that at the beginning. But after going through all the process and got the offer, I think part of this is just, do the best preparation you can, but when in the interview, don\\'t think too much about \"I should answer like this or that\", just focus on the question itself and try to answer them smoothly. Even you don\\'t know the answer, the internal employers won\\'t expect us to know all of the technical questions, try to give them an positive impression when you face difficulties.  Definitely get extra monitors, it really helps with online classes while taking notes, but also really helpful when you code. Take notes during class (whether they are hand written or type) as just looking at the slide deck will not be enough. Taking notes helps create a useful tool that acts as a study guide and can be used to brush up on technical skills during interview season in the Spring.  Reach out to alumni in the workforce as early as possible (read: SUMMER). Do it before recruiting starts. Most alumni are willing to chat for 30 mins about their job and experience with their current company. If you get that information early, it can help streamline your efforts during recruiting season to focus on the companies you really want to work for! Be who you want to be. It was overwhelming when I first started to be a part of teams with people who had much more working experience, technical background, or comfort in the field. It can be daunting and imposter syndrome is more common than you might think. At the end of the day, remember that everyone\\'s grad school experience is different and you want it to benefit yourself as much as you hopefully enjoy it. Be comfortable from whatever starting position you are at, work towards whatever goals you set for yourself, and leverage the faculty and alumni to help you be the best you.  Life happens, if something extreme in your personal life disrupts your learning reach out to the faculty and your teammates for extra support.  Remember that you are here to learn. It\\'s okay to make mistakes. It\\'s okay to go to professors and ask for help for the 100th time.  Take care of yourself. Exercise, sleep, go to church, do something fun. There is always something to do so be sure to do something for yourself. Something someone mentioned last year that rings true: \"The days are long and the year is short.\" Enjoy this time in the program learning from each other and growing as a data scientist. Find a comprehensive list of interview questions, both technical and \"tell me about a time when\" type questions, and fill them out as you go through the program. This will save you some prep work so you can better focus on the \"stressing out\" part of interviews. I used a SharePoint site for my homework team instead of a Google Drive folder. I had never done it before the program, but it’s quick and easy. Using SharePoint/Microsoft 365, we were able to edit documents and slide decks as a team instead of risking losing formatting in Google Docs. Check if you are unmute when you enter a meeting!  Get uncomfortable with the material. Work on the hard things. The best lesson you could learn from the IAA is how to succeed when you are thrown into an unknown space such as data science/computer science/programming. If you spend the year welcoming the challenges and let go of the fear of making a mistake (which takes time and practice) you will be incredibly equipped for your career and life. Grades are NOT what is important at the IAA. Your individual growth as a leader, teammate, and analytics professional is what is important. If you bomb a test, dig deep, learn from it and improve for the next one. As you grow and keep learning, things will get much easier and you will learn so much. You will be tested throughout the year but it will truly be for the better. Good luck :)!!! Regardless of your qualities, background, skills, practicum project, grades, and progress in the interviewing and job search areas, always remember this: you are writing your own story. Don\\'t ever compare yourself to someone else. The true beauty of this world is that everyone is different and everyone will find their next career stepping stone at different points in time. Trust the process, but try to find the beauty in it as well. Having a group of friends in the program that you can lean on, particularly during the job search process, is wonderful. The program is much more fun if you have people that you can share it with, both the highs and the lows. Plus, there are so many amazing people in the program! Take advantage and build a network - it will last you beyond the program as well! Make good use of datacamp to sharpen your programming skills. You will likely experience imposter syndrome at some point... almost everyone from the Class of 2021 did. Try to recognize any feelings like that early on, talk it through with classmates (because you are not alone in feeling that way) or a coach, and whatever you do, don\\'t let those feelings hold you back from getting the most out of this program! Try not to over-stress during the job search season. Your coach and April have your best interests in mind! Trust the process Treat every interview as a final interview. Some companies will make their decisions on one day of interviews, while others will have several rounds without letting you know at the beginning.  Don\\'t get too stressed about virtual networking. It can be more difficult to have interactions that don\\'t feel like \"cold calling\" people, but with practice, you\\'ll get the hang of it. Focus on quality of interactions rather than quantity. Remember to ask April for advice. Ask questions even if no one else is!!!! During class, info sessions, group meetings, etc. This helps show your attentiveness, interests, and desire along with clearing up something that everyone was probably wondering. The program can be very stressful so make sure to take a little time to yourself to recharge and do things you enjoy. It will help prevent the burnout that can happen if you constantly push yourself too much. If you\\'re coming in with little to no coding experience, the most important thing you can do is practice practice practice. Most of your peers are holding the same fears and thinking someone else is going to step up and code in your breakout room/homework group. Don\\'t be afraid to be the one volunteering to screen share because no one is going to judge you for getting it wrong and you\\'ll end up learning more from being the active coder.  As hard as it is, try not to compare yourself, focus on what makes you unique and use it as your secret weapon going into interviews.  Utilize the faculty! They are so willing to help and their breadth of knowledge in all areas is really impressive. Feel comfortable setting boundaries with your teammates. Just because you can be available 24/7 doesn\\'t mean you should. Set aside some time that belongs to you and make it clear to your teammates that you won\\'t respond to messages after a certain time at night or on Sundays or whatever you choose. It will help you maintain sanity and help your teammates plan their own schedules better. You may even want to block these times off on your Google Calendar so they have a visual reminder. Use the summer to figure out your ideal notetaking strategies. Find whatever system or app that works for you. Now might be the right time to invest in a second monitor or maybe a table for taking notes on class slides. Especially for those right out of undergrad, sign up for any career interest list that could remotely interest you, even if it is not a dream job. The search is harder for those without work experience, so give yourself every opportunity you can.  As you move through the program, think about what sets you apart as an individual. Sure, you probably like coding, math, and statistics, but where do your other interests lie? Develop your skillset by applying programming and analytics toward those interests. Any topic out there has a number of questions that can be addressed with analytics. Scope out a side project surrounding that topic, and tackle it. It can take as little as 3 weeks or as long as 6 months. In any case, it\\'s a great opportunity to learn, and you will be able to reference your work during job interviews. Make condensed review sheets after each module for each class -- it will be much easier to review for interviews if you only have one page of condensed notes for each class rather than the whole module\\'s worth of material Try to understand how you receive feedback as soon as you can There will be days where you feel like you’re doing everything wrong Use Notion or OneNote for online note taking. At least try notion if you’re using evernote, it has everything evernote has and way more and does what evernote does better This program is a fantastic opportunity. It’s not just an opportunity to learn a lot about the data science and analytics, it’s also an opportunity to learn and develop a lot of soft skills. Don’t just rely on the faculty and staff, as well as your classmates, to teach you things; you also need to be self-reliant. Nothing worthwhile is handed to you; you have to work for it. So, take this time to understand, challenge, and develop yourself. Think about your likes and dislikes, the type of people you want to work with and the type of person you want to be. And then work towards that. And when there are frustrations and issues that come along (with your classmates, the work load, or course material), DO NOT be quick to complain; instead, challenge yourself to find a silver lining.  Reach out to alumni to make connections early-- mainly to just see what you could be interested in working in. It\\'s just as valuable to discover an industry is not for you. Also, these connections can turn into mentorship!  If you can, work on a side project involving something that excites you. This makes a great talking point during interviews.  Take time to get to know people. This is (probably) the last time you\\'ll be in school, so enjoy spending time with these people! You could form some lifelong friendships. Try to think about and write your peer feedback before the feedback window opens. That way, you can copy and paste instead of rushing to write feedback for eight or nine people at one time. Have fun and all, but you have to make sacrifices. This is only a 10-month program and it\\'s the most valuable time you can get. Really lean in and focus-- you should be spending most of your time on IAA work. Do other things to prevent yourself from burning out, but focus on the IAA. Be kind to your classmates. They will be your greatest network and chance for referrals in the future, and you might even work with several of them right after graduation.  In class and meetings be engaged  Do not pretend to be good at everything in an interview. Take an honest look at your strenghts and weaknesses. The feedback you get will help with this. Companies want to hire someone who is confident, which means you are secure in what you can do AND what you can\\'t do. The Fall is super busy, especially Fall 2 and Fall 3. Find something to do outside of the IAA to take your mind off of school work. I enjoyed playing IM sports and I always looked forward to the upcoming game days. You will be surprised at how many other people in the program have similar interests. Find a way to de-stress from school. Your mental health is so important and you will need to take time for yourself! Have fun. I would do the program again if I could.  Put in a lot of time and effort into getting a job. It takes a lot of work, but you\\'ll be fine if you listen to April. Rely on your teammates and fellow classmates! Everyone in the program is learning the same concepts and materials; use each other to study, do homework, review material, etc. This will help so much in the long term. You are truly part of a team at the Institute.  Enjoy the process! You will be told countless times to \"Trust the Process\", but it is also important to appreciate the experience. You will be surrounded by amazing, talented people. Do your best to take time for recreational activities, meet and develop relationships with your peers, and have fun! This will be one of the most memorable experiences of your life, and it should be shared with others going through the same thing. It is very possible you will form some of your best lifelong friendships. You will be surprised how easily you will begin to live off of your Google Calendar. Make sure to start putting all events on there (including non-academic related events). If there isn\\'t an event on your calendar, you are more likely to forget about it. Even though they seem to be superhuman, keep in mind that your professors and the staff at the IAA are human. They work extremely hard to make this process a success every year. Appreciate that, appreciate them, and understand that their every action is intended for your benefit. No pressure, no diamonds. This program is hard, no doubt about it, but it is also arguably the most rewarding experience I have ever gone through and worth every hour of sweat and pain. Everyone in it is here to support you. Invest in at least two (ideally three) full sets of business formal wear. As the fall semester moves along, there are sometimes three employer information sessions in a week in addition to presentations, all of which require business formal attire. Some practicum sponsor meetings may also require this level of dress so it is a good idea to have a few full outfits to rotate through. This is also a requirement for interviews so go ahead and invest in decent formal attire, get it tailored, and be ready to hit the ground running. Do not be afraid to use google, stackoverflow, github etc. to learn things. Take the lesson materials as the main methodologies for teaching but know that you may have to go outside of them for understanding of certain things. This is a new, cutting edge field and it is impossible for the lessons to have everything you would ever need to know. Stay healthy. Get sleep, eat decently, and try to practice self-care as much as possible. This can be very difficult in the most stressful parts of the program but getting sick will just make things that much more difficult. The best way to learn is to teach your classmates and let them teach you.\\nTalk to your professors. You get out what you put in, whether that\\'s doing a part of the hw you weren\\'t assigned so you can brush up your skills, or trying out a method learned in class that didn\\'t have a formal assignment. If you have the time and mental energy to go the extra mile here and there, it\\'s worth it.  As a woman team lead, having a support group of fellow women team leads was instrumental in boosting my confidence and overcoming imposter syndrome. Talking through the highs and lows of leadership with people going through similar experiences helped me immensely.  RESPECT YOUR PEERS. Do not undermine anyone for their background or amount of work experience. Everyone brings something valuable to the table, and these could be your future coworkers. Take a break and make friends! There is a lot of new information being thrown at you. Apply rule of 3 when it comes to the material: Review the slides before class, pay attention during class and go over the video recordings. This way you will understand the material.  Keep an open mind during information sessions. There were some information sessions that I thought were so boring & the people weren\\'t the most exciting but then I\\'d interview with them & really love them. We get nervous when we present & sometimes they do too! I know it\\'s hard to not judge a company by their information session but keep in mind the company & the team are usually more than the people who come to present. On the other hand, remember that really large companies may have really flashy giveaways & presentations but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re better than the smaller companies. All of the companies that come through are great & any/all would be lucky to have you! Build relationships with classmates Trust April  When connecting with faculty or classmates over zoom, remember to use video as often as possible. It really makes a difference when you can see the faces. Also, be an active participant in the calls, share your thoughts and answer questions whenever possible.  Don\\'t forget to stop and smell the roses. This is different for everyone, but it involves doing something that you enjoy and that makes you feel good. This could involve going out for a beer, doing your favorite hobby, or just having great conversation with your classmates.  Make friends from this program Start networking early. Identify the companies/industries that interest you or just curious about, and reach out to alums in those places to set up informational interview and establish connections.  Connect with classmates; you can learn as much from them as you do the curriculum, and it is good to have people in which to rely.  Challenge yourself to learn python! Take notes during information sessions so you can use phrases and insights when writing cover letters and interviewing later on. If you ever copy and paste code from online and use it, do your absolute best to understand how and why it works. This will develop your programming skills a lot faster and you\\'ll be happy you did! Don\\'t be afraid to ask for help. Your classmates, your teammates, the faculty and the staff are all willing to help you out, but you need to ask. This is especially true for the practicum -take time to go to faculty office hours and ask them questions 1-on-1, I often found that to be more valuable than just waiting until the next faculty review meeting.  You are not just getting a degree you are getting a community. Connect with alumni and current students. Work that network during the interview season and use LinkedIn to is fullest. You can search for managers and recruiters from a company you would like to work for on LinkedIn. It is possible to get an interview without submitting an application. Get your name out there and talk to as many people as you can.  Don\\'t compare yourself too much with your fellow classmates since everyone comes from different backgrounds and everyone has their unique talent. Time management is key.  Your practicum team will be like your family for 8 months. If you run into problems with anyone, it\\'s better to talk it out than to keep it bottled up. Don\\'t compare yourself too much with your fellow classmates since everyone comes from different backgrounds and everyone has their unique talent. Have fun! The program flies by and you should take advantage of the activities and trips organized by the IAA students.  Be confident in your abilities. You are the only one limiting your potential growth. Take feedback from coaching seriously, it\\'ll help you grow personally and become a good team player. Work hard, but also schedule time for social events with your practicum team. It is important to get to know your teammates. Volunteer for tasks in your homework or practicum team that you are the weakest in. This is a great opportunity to learn in a safe space and improve what you need to learn. Your teammates that are more experienced in these areas will not mind you struggling slowly with a task they could do in 30 minutes, so long as you put in the effort.  You can\\'t always judge a company by their info session. Talk to the alum that work in these places outside of networking to get a good feel for the work and work environment.  Did you know that Google Drive has a desktop application that you can use to sync all of your work? This allows you to always have an accessible backup of all of your work all of the time. You\\'re here to learn as much as possible, but don\\'t stress about grades.  The analytics education is great, but what sets us apart is our ability to communicate.  The communication training is one of the most important parts of the program.  Don\\'t fight it, embrace it! Mentally prepare yourself for the March/April part of the year. Classes and the job search will be coming to an end, so it\\'s easy to lose motivation in the practicum. Don\\'t fall into that group - you\\'re so close, just push through and finish as well as you can! Don\\'t stress too much.  The program goes by extremely fast and you\\'ll learn a ton.  But make sure to have fun and enjoy it while it lasts! Networking does not apply to just employers, it is also important with professors, classmates, and the rest of the staff! Someone in your class needs to plan events for everyone to take part in. Maybe a beach trip, a camping trip, a white water rafting trip, paintball, bar outings, an end of the year gathering, ... what ever you like to do. Maybe that someone is you.  Keep all of your notes extremely organized from the start. I recommend OneNote. This also means commenting your code!  win the battle AND the war  Don\\'t compare yourself too much to the other students. Everyone is accepted into the program for different talents, and if someone is better than you at a task it means you\\'re stronger in other areas. And conversely, realize that even if you\\'re better than someone at a task, you\\'ll still need their expertise in other areas to finish a project. Plan your weeks around spending some quality time with the professors and TAs during office hours. This is your chance to ask questions and identify gaps in your understanding. Don\\'t expect to do all of the work on all assignments or be an expert in all of the tools and techniques. The program gives you a solid base, but there is a lot more to learn and practice, so balance learning with fun. If you have significant work experience (manager or above) - Apply to EVERY company.  The ones that are interested in your experience will connect with you. If you like a company, don\\'t let other students\\' opinions sway you - everyone has a different fit. Practice interviews with classmates before interview season starts - you\\'ll definitely get better the more interviews you have, so start practicing early so you can start your first real interviews strong! During networking season, keep tupperware in your locker at all times to capitalize on leftovers. Participate: in class, teams, practicum, and job search. You get out what you put in. Don\\'t hesitate to ask for help from teammates or faculty.  Don\\'t sweat about grades, pay attention and do your work and you will be prepared. If you don\\'t have a strong coding background, that\\'s okay, but start working on improving your skills now, especially in R, Python, and SQL. Take advantage of the DataCamp subscription provided by the Institute or find other online resources to your liking.  Don\\'t stay stuck on a problem for three days - talk to the faculty instead and get help! Take good notes in the employer info sessions. It will make preparing for interviews months later much easier. When you go into interviews, be able to speak in depth about pieces of code that you\\'ve written for your practicum. Employers are interested in specifically knowing what your contributions have been to the practicum team. Don\\'t take things too seriously. Yes school is important but it is not life or death. Enjoy it and let the problems roll off your back. It\\'s all fixable.  Get to know your classmates! If they got into the IAA, most likely they\\'re amazing and talented. You can meet lifelong friends! Get to know your practicum and classmates outside the classroom setting. Chances are they are amazing and will be lifelong friends!  Do things outside of class with your classmates -- go to the mountains, beach, etc. You may be super busy, but it\\'s always worth it to find time! Don\\'t get your hopes up too high for practicum sponsors. You may not get one of your top choices, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a great learning experience! Focus on the subjects that are the most challenging to you. The rest will come easier later if you need it!  Don\\'t let the \"Fall 3 is coming!\" boogeyman scare you. Yes, Fall 2 and Fall 3 are very busy, and you will have a lot of work, but by then you will have found a rhythm that works for you and developed strong connections with classmates that will help you get through it together. You got this!  Don\\'t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, whether it\\'s from classmates or professors, etc. Imposter syndrome is a real thing and initially I often felt I wasn\\'t up to par with my classmates because I didn\\'t have a stats/coding background, but it\\'s something so many people experience!! The coaches really helped me with this, and my teams were really good about talking things through and making sure everyone was on the same page once I mentioned I didn\\'t completely understand what was going on. You\\'re here to learn as much as everyone else so don\\'t be afraid to take advantage of the resources provided to you! R Markdown files are great when writing R code. Being able to break the code into chunks without having rows upon rows of ##### as separators makes the code so much easier to read and work through. Have at least a monthly social event with your practicum team. Awesome for bonding together! For the Fall and Spring semesters, I highly recommend attending student-led lectures. If you hadn\\'t thought about it, go ahead and find classmates willing to share their knowledge from their professional and/or student careers.  Whenever you feel stressed out or overwhelmed, talk to other people, your classmates, staff, or faculty, they usually have great advice to chill you down.  Listen to your peer evaluation comments and make adjustments accordingly. There will probably/definitely be some people every class who have a lot of negative things to say about others behind their backs (I am not talking about giving constructive feedback, I am talking about just talking \"crap\"). Do not be one of these people. Its very unprofessional and not classy.  You get out of the program what you put into the program. Learn as much as you can outside of the curriculum to stand out in interviews Play intramural sports! indoor/outdoor soccer is a blast. It is a great way to blow off some steam as well as get to know your classmates in a way you otherwise might not. MSA 2018 took some titles so MSA 2019 better keep the streak alive!  Code as much as your possibly can.   Your classmates are your professional network, so keep it professional. One day you may want a job, and an old classmate may be in charge of hiring. You want them to remember how great you were to work with. Be collaborative and help those around you get better. You gain nothing by trying to be the best and always doing things solo. Instead, challenge others to improve in areas they struggle, help them by using your strengths to teach and encourage them. This will serve others and yourself. For those with family and/or significant others, make part of your schedule spending time with them. You will be busy, so make time for them in your schedule. Start learning how to do analysis in R and Python immediately. Try not to do everything in SAS.  Trust the process. Sometimes it may feel tough, but everything works out. Between, school, finding a job, and trying to remember the modeling assumption, you learned last week. The process is meant to be hard but once you make it to the end, you come out with new skills and knowledge you may not acquire else where. You will also be employed, so do not panic.  Networking is extremely important for outside job searches as well as internal. If you\\'re trying to get a job in a specific locale, try to visit and meet with people who work in places that interest you for informational interviews (like during winter break). If not, join local meetup groups for that area even if you can\\'t make it to a physical meeting and see if you can contact any of the members on LinkedIn about your interest. I got my job by joining a Slack group for data scientists in my area of interest in my locale of interest, and following their jobs channel. I found the link to this Slack group in a meetup page on meetup.com. I also gained a mentor by simply connecting to people in that meetup group. Also take advantage of local alumni, if there are any. You remind alumni of themselves, and as such they are always happy to help. :) Don\\'t waste time outside of class. You\\'ve got a short time to learn as much as possible. Only Burger is the best food truck  You will be seeing a lot of your practicum team over the 8 project months. Paired with the homework team rotation, which gives you experience in calibrating to different team dynamics, the practicum team exposes you to how longer-term projects can develop. At least having amicable relationships with your team members will make it that much more enjoyable and build camaraderie to carry you through long analysis sprints. Really get to know your teammates. It is way more enjoyable to be working with friends as opposed to strangers. Studying for classes is undoubtedly important -- it\\'s why you\\'re here. But also spend time doing other things -- working on a passion project or spending time with the amazing people you\\'re surrounded by. This 10 months FLIES BY. If you are selected as a practicum team lead, remember to respect your team\\'s time.  If you can avoid having meetings outside of Institute hours do so.  When it is all said and done, your team will appreciate not meeting on a Saturday or having 8:00am meetings.  Be brave to share your opinions, be humble to learn from your classmates, be ready to push your boundaries. Ask questions! Not only will this help you learn material faster but learning to ask the right questions is a good skill to hone for when you are in the workforce and having to learn on the job. DON\\'T slack off. As much as you want to resist it, really try and trust the process Be sure to investigate topics beyond what\\'s covered in class. Class is an introduction and exposure if you enjoy a topic be sure to seek out additional materials.  Hang out with your practicum team outside of working on the project, you will make some long lasting friendships and your project will be that much better!  Be open to working with other students who may have different work styles.  Try to tweak your own so that you can work well with other students. If you have a question do not let it go, ask someone. Professors are amazing at answering questions and going over material with you after class. Everyone will get at least one turn as a homework team lead, which is a great experience.  Homework team lead doesn\\'t mean you do all the work, you just need to make sure it gets done and is of good quality.  Teams ran most smoothly when everyone had assigned tasks, And preferably on a Google Doc. Take as many certifications as possible as early as possible. Skim lectures for the next day on the night before. It introduces you to the material prior to class, so the firehouse of information will feel more like a squirt gun.  Listen to data science podcasts, e.g. Linear Digressions and Data Skeptic (both good for newbies) and Talking Machines (a little more advanced and better for after you feel more comfortable). The job search can be stressful, but be confident in your abilities. You are here because you are capable.  The sooner you realize you will not be able to learn everything the better. Once you find something you really enjoy, try to do extra projects and expand on the subject matter.  The institute always has your best interest in mind and you can place your trust in that.  Print off the SAS e-learning summaries for each lesson to help you study for the certification exams. Make sure to enjoy your experience and make connections with your classmates, the program goes by faster than you would think. Get to know your classmates! I was new to the area and didn\\'t know a soul before my first day of school, but I can definitely say that I made some lifelong friends. It is worth it to put in the effort to attend (or plan) social events. You will get to know some very neat people! Take full advantage of all the professors. Don\\'t only get to know them through just schoolwork, get to know them all on a personal basis. Find small side projects of skills that interest you personally to cultivate in the program.  You won\\'t enjoy everything you\\'re learning and these personal projects can sustain you as well as complement your resume come job time. Embrace Slack.  It was the most valuable tool my classmates and I used all year.  Make channels for everything (practicum teams, homework teams, classes, certification prep, job hunting, etc) and start communicating with each other.   Enjoy the job search process.  Comment your code and keep everything organized for your practicum from the very beginning. Have team members validate each other\\'s code as you go along. Attempting to do all of this and getting together deliverables for your sponsors last minute will not be fun. Keep your chin up during the job search. You\\'ll never know why you got or didn\\'t get an interview. You\\'re not competing against others, you\\'re trying to put your best foot forward every time. You can only control how your interviews go.  Study hard, but build great relationships and have fun! The year goes by quickly and you will otherwise miss out if you don\\'t make time for fun. Team building is not a single event or a block to check when forming your teams. It\\'s a continuous process that requires your effort no matter how challenging or demanding the academic environment becomes. Do it often and it will make your experience more enjoyable.  Do things outside of school with your practicum and homework groups as well as classmates in general - it\\'s a great way to get to know each other, and it will make working together more fun. Keep an open mind. Some of the lesser well known companies make the best offers.  Be curious Talk to other people about what they\\'re doing to learn on the side - you will have some free time so take advantage of it by doing exercise and extra learning (OPEN SOURCE - udemy and coursera are your friends..). You will not be able to absorb all of the information taught over the course of the year. One strategy to retain a little bit more is to continuously evaluate if you can use any of the methods on your practicum project. Tackling a problem using multiple approaches can provide insight.  Even if you only spend a couple of days trying an approach that is ultimately abandoned, the applied experience (and struggling with a real and complex dataset- not just something from a homework assignment) will help you understand the information at a deeper level.   Have fun! Be involved in every homework assignment in some capacity. Remember to take care of yourself during the program! Exercise and eat well. Branch out and try things out of your comfort zone in terms of modeling and programming.  OneNote is also a great ally and CTRL+F a wonderful keyboard command. Remember that you\\'re paying to be here, and keep the end goal in mind.  Focus your attention on a few specific areas that interest you, but don\\'t try to master everything, it\\'s not possible.   FIND A MENTOR (especially if you are fresh out of undergrad). Seeking out a peer with many years of work experience will make the transition much easier. Furthermore, your classmates with military experience are full of insight into dealing with the stress of working in teams. Trust the process. The faculty and staff know what they\\'re doing and care deeply about your success. Treat them with the respect that they deserve and go with the flow on things, even if you don\\'t always see the relevance of a particular class, talk, or other mandatory event. It will all pay off in the end. Enjoy your time here. You will be surround by a lot of awesome people. proofread. Try not to get too caught up with your grade performance (GPA), the main point is that you understand how to do the work and you learn from your mistakes by correcting any unlearned information. I didn\\'t think I needed the coaching sessions but they have been one of my favorite parts about the program. Really reflect on yourself. This is a safe space to grow as a person, a professional, and as a leader.  Be humble and listen to your teammates! Do some of your own investigating before running for help. Make sure you keep your life balanced throughout the program. Find people to workout, go out, and hang out with. Also, make sure you unplug everyone once in a while. It’s easy to spend all your waking hours on the material, but you will burn out if you do.\\n Bring your team snacks. There is no closed form solution Do the SAS e-learning , especially in the summer, if you have no programming experience coming into the program. Think about what industry/kind of work you want to do early. This will help with both your interviews (and standing out) as well as provide focus for certain classes.  When job search time comes around, be prepared to adjust your expectations to fit the opportunities that you have and not the opportunities that you want. It\\'s not going to get easier. You\\'re going to hear rumors about which module is easier, but they are all demanding. You\\'ll get better at managing it, but you\\'ll be on from now until April. Accept it, relinquish control of your schedule, and enjoy the ride. It\\'s tough, but it\\'s also wonderful. You\\'re going to learn so much and make deep and meaningful friendships with you classmates and the coaches and professors. On a related note-- those same classmates and coaches will never let you fail. Put in the work and you will make it. Manage expectations well Time management and planning ahead will help you succeed in completing the program. Use version control for practicum or things will get very messy, very quickly Keep talking with people you sit around, you never know when someone you made a small friendship with will be able to answer a question you have further down the road. Rewatching lectures (or going through notes) before doing assignments is extremely helpful. You might feel like delving straight into an assignment saves time but most often you\\'ll find that watching the lectures before hand actually makes you work faster. Trust the IAA team, they are looking out of your best interests and have 9 solid years of experience.  Be patient during the interview process update your computer Pull your weight within your teams, your grades will reflect your peer evaluations Focus on the task of the moment and do not get overly caught up in the past or future at any give point during the year. Manage your time on Google Calendar, studying, chilling, white space, social events. Have fun. I wish I had participated in outside activities with fellow students. Getting a job outside of the Institute recruitment IS possible, but it will be easier if you are able to find an HR person or recruiter on LinkedIn and let them know you submitted your application. Employers that are familiar with the Institute but are not coming to campus are also good places to target. Pay attention in class, don\\'t skip anything - this isn\\'t your undergrad course!  Learn R on your own, as soon as possible, and do outside projects.  Take time to get out and explore Raleigh. There\\'s plenty to do for everybody and it\\'ll help make the year a lot more fun. NLP for this assignment will be helpful. Save all your IAA documents in google drive and create shared folders for your team in each module. Save the word documents for your reports in One Drive instead of Google Drive. Seriously.  Networking is the most important part of your job search You\\'ll survive. The Fall is difficult due to the high velocity of coursework and projects, but the Spring is more laid back and focuses on Practicum work. Do expect to spend a lot of time preparing for interviews in the Spring. Make sure to talk to all the professors and embrace every opportunity and resource provided at the institute.  make sure you get to know your teammates outside of the classroom - do fun things together often! Take the time to get to know your peers across cohorts. There are a number of student groups and activities (IM leagues, social events etc.) that happen outside the normal 9-5 so try and take the time to get to know your peers across cohorts. Don\\'t apply to every job just because you can, but be ready to be frustrated when someone who does gets an interview and you don\\'t. Have trust in the faculty and staff - especially during the job search. They\\'ve been doing this for a long time and are looking out for you! Trust the system.  The IAA team has put much thought into how things are done and they have had years of feedback from students.  Trusting the system will save a lot of hassle and time. Be confident during the job hunting, and think thoroughly before you accept an offer. Learn how to prioritize early on. You cannot be a perfectionist in this program. Ask others for help if you don\\'t understand something! There are always classmates who are willing to help. Don\\'t freak out if you don\\'t master every concept. Focus on what you are passionate about.  Spend your time during the employer networking sessions talking with the employers rather than socializing with classmates - it will help you stand out come interview season. If you are new to programming, look into resources like Codingbat for Python, Swirl for R, and codeacademy in general.  Even learning how to open files and submit command lines in new languages is beneficial instead of never opening the software. Have fun, relax and make friends. This will be one of the best, yet very tough, experiences you have. Milk it for all its worth. Work hard and explore the unparalleled breadth of knowledge you have access too.  The summer project is not about getting amazing results. It\\'s about proving to the faculty, staff, and your peers that you know how to get along.  Never make any assumptions and never give up your efforts during the job hunting process. Anything can happen, for real! IT GETS BETTER.  The first few months are stressful with getting used to the workload and getting used to being a new place, but in time it all gets easier to handle.  This program is totally worth it, so don\\'t stress out! Take time to get to know your classmates / participate in intramurals   Use your winter break wisely. Begin applying for jobs outside the Institute, practicing interviews, and reviewing technical material. You won\\'t have as much time as you think once the spring semester starts. Talk to each professor a few times outside of class. Find something you don\\'t understand about their topic and make the time. It\\'s worth it. Take good notes! Don\\'t worry about the TIPS project so much. It\\'s purpose is to see how well you work in teams and how creative you can be. Presentations get easier with time.  I do have some tips to prepare you for the interviews if you easily get nervous or anxious. They are fast-paced. After they ask you a question, if you need a chance to catch your breath, then ask them a question after you give your answer. They will speak for a little bit and take the pressure away from you, giving you some time to slow your heartrate. Come prepared with as many questions as possible - or even suggestions. This will demonstrate your interest.  Put your mental health and relationships, above the Institute, always. Health and relationships will persist while the Institute of Advanced An-al-yt-ics is temporary. Prioritizing with intention is beyond important! It\\'s useful to have prior knowledge of Python and Tableau before starting the program, and if you\\'re interested, you can also start exploring analytical concepts, such as Natural Language Processing or Deep Neural Networks Soak up all of the analytics, communication, and career knowledge that you can this year! It can feel overwhelming at times, but I feel much more prepared to be a data scientist now than I did a year ago.  Talk with the faculty. They\\'re great! Give yourself a break even when you think you can\\'t afford one. I pulled many late nights both in the Fall and the Spring. However, I found myself working almost every waking hour in the Fall. Retrospectively, I probably had workaholic tendencies but at the time it felt very necessary given the work load and being a team lead. My body couldn\\'t sustain that same momentum come Spring. I gave myself a lot more breaks to eat a proper dinner, spend more time with family, and just plain relax. If you\\'re a workaholic like me you know how difficult that is to do, but it is very crucial to physical and mental health as well.  It is okay to be vulnerable here. That is where the best growth happens.  I recommend consolidating all your class notes into documents so that it will be easy for you to find the information you want after you graduate. It\\'ll be difficult to know everything perfectly during the program, so creating this collection of documents will be handy when you\\'re on the job. It\\'s almost impossible to try to do this for all the courses at once. So try to do it a little at a time, when you\\'re taking the course. When you go for a walk to grab coffee, go to the Caribou Coffee at Hunt and not the PCJ. You\\'re welcome Self study Python throughout the entire program, even in the beginning when it isn\\'t used as much in classes. Ultimately, it\\'ll all feel worth it - you\\'ll be a part of a fantastic cohort of strong analytics professionals, so don\\'t stress too hard. Celebrate all wins (small or large) - and take time to breath. You\\'re here for a reason. You can do this. You\\'ve got this.  Communicate often with you practicum and homework teams. Over communication is rarely a problem. Your teams will love it if they hear from you often.  Good luck with your TIPS presentation! Don\\'t overthink it :) DONT write off anyone and BE NICE to everyone. This is a tight network and you never know when that person you couldn\\'t stand on your HW team is your only connection at your dream company. You don\\'t want a burned bridge to stop you from reaching your goals. Get help from faculty immediately when you are stuck! Time is valuable in the program. Counseling with Joe is a fantastic service provided by the program -- don\\'t be afraid to take advantage of it for any little (or big) thing. It\\'s okay to be a loner, if you are efficient and you value your time away from the institute, that\\'s an okay thing to value.  Start early with preparing for the job search process! You’ll do a mock interview with an alumni in December, but don’t stop there until the process kicks up again in February. I suggest taking winter break as a break (don’t burn yourself out), but come back strong in early January. I formed a study group with some people where we did four hour sessions around two times a week studying and interviewing each other. It really paid off because all of us got job offers pretty early on! Job search is a stressful period, and just try your best to prepare for it, but remember that there is also a lot of luck to it. If you get rejections or are not invited for the first round of interviews, it can be for various reasons. The companies are looking for different things, sometimes, your goals do not match, but it does not mean that you are doing anything wrong. If that happens, talk to April and Kate, practice the interview with them, and review your resume and cover letter. They are there to help you.  The days go slow, but the year goes fast Try not to stress too much - you\\'re gonna do great! If you are a parent, you might be feeling anxious about this uncertain journey you\\'re about to embark on. Yes, it is possible to succeed in this program as a parent. Use the alumni network to get strategies and support. Set a goal to make it through Summer to December full steam. After December, your stress will change from managing a schedule  into finding a job but you will have more time to spend with your family. Don\\'t worry, you will find a job. Just remember, you are juggling two full time jobs right now: a student and a parent. You\\'re a super person. Try practicing your skills outside the classroom with a side project. I highly recommend a data challenge like the Carolina Data Challenge which happens in the fall because then you\\'re done with the project in a week and you can work with other people. These extra projects will give you something extra that you can talk about in interviews.  Develop a routine! You will be busy during your time at the IAA, and having a routine can help you develop some structure as you navigate that workload. It helps you avoid being overwhelmed and prevents that feeling of scrambling to get things done. \\n\\nEmbrace the \\'suck.\\' The IAA will be challenging and stressful, but that is ok. The faculty know the program is a demanding experience, and there are times you might feel overwhelmed or feel tested by the experience. However, that is normal, and it is ok to embrace that experience. That is not to say you should bottle up all that stress and anxiety, but rather that you should accept those feelings are present and try and do something to address them. Talk to your coach, take advantage of counseling, talk with your peers, and lean on your support network. The program can be arduous, but embracing that can help you grow and learn more about yourself. The IAA is a family. This goes for your class but also for the alumni network. Reach out to any of us and we will be happy to talk! Save your code! You\\'ll be referencing it frequently throughout the program. Don\\'t skimp on preparing for interviews. As a sometimes socially anxious person who struggles with speaking eloquently in high pressure situations, I think I would have been a lot more successful during interview season if I had taken the time to craft strong examples of how I excel with technical projects and refresh my memory of statistical concepts learned in the fall. While I knew I SHOULD prepare, the task felt overwhelming, and I more or less procrastinated until it was too late. While you can\\'t possibly know everything, feeling prepared with a few great examples for both technical and behavioral questions will go a long way - be sure to practice saying them out loud! Sammy\\'s Trivia on Tuesdays. This program will take as much time from you as you allow. While it is essential to maximize your experience at the IAA, remember that life doesn\\'t stop while you are here and to truly be successful in the program, you can\\'t let your personal life unravel. You may experience personal loss (death of loved ones, breakups) and struggle with the stress of the program (addiction, anxiety/panic attacks) - just know there are resources available to you to help you navigate. I found the coaching sessions and counseling sessions to be really helpful. I also was intentional in time-boxing assignments. If I was still struggling with a concept or troubleshooting code, I would schedule time with a TA (there are amazing TAs dedicated to helping you throughout each module!). At night, to help get my mind off everything and to fall asleep, I would try and read an engrossing book. Hopefully, these tips will help you! You can do it! And before you know it, you will be done!!! I am sad to see this amazing year come to an end. I never thought I could grow or learn as much as I have in the past 10 months, and to meet incredible people along the way is truly the cherry on top! Work hard, don\\'t forget to have fun, and cherish the close frienships For those who love nature, go kayaking with friends (bonus points for Sunset/Nighttime kayaking) with Frog Hollow Outdoors at Falls Lake in Durham. Also go hiking/walking with friends, there are TONS of parks and nature preserves in the triangle area. My personal favorite were Lake Lynn, Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area, Bass Lake, and Hemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve. The days are long, but the year is short. Enjoy the ride! Take advantage of your virtual resources. Zoom meetings can be really efficient especially for team members that would be commuting to the IAA from farther distances. Consider making any meetings that occur outside of business hours Zoom meetings. Don\\'t worry about TIPS that say Fall 1 was the hardest, Fall 2 was the worst.. etc. Just focus on what you have to get done and you will be fine. Everyone\\'s experience is different depending on teams, practicum, and prior knowledge of the topics. You\\'re in this program for a reason, so even when you feel like you might be struggling just keep pushing and everything will be okay. It will all be over a lot faster than you think.  Really, don\\'t worry about your grades. Just focus on learning. Make sure to stay connected with Career Services throughout job season, they can really help. If you\\'re struggling with a certain class or specific material, brainstorm a side project that involves that topic. You\\'ll grasp a concept much more effectively if you can apply to something you\\'re passionate or interested in. Additionally, upload the project to a public GitHub repository to display to potential employers. \\nGet ahead and stay ahead.  If you establish and maintain order in your life, you can reduce your stress and focus better, especially when contending with surprises.  Think of this certainly in an academic sense (do work when it\\'s assigned, not when it\\'s due) but also in a personal sense.  During the program, I started/maintained a cleaning routine for my place, achieved/maintained empty inboxes for all my email accounts, etc., and I found that those little things helped me out quite a bit. Make the most of technical communication as a resource. Being able to tailor your presentations and reports to your audience and be engaging is incredibly valuable. Employers don\\'t just want employees who can analyze data, they want employees who can also interface with stakeholders. The soft skills you develop in the program may be some of the most valuable skills you learn in these 10 months.\\n Take Dr. West\\'s project management lectures seriously. Your practicum is a big undertaking. Scoping out and managing timelines for an 8-month project is hard and Dr. West provides resources in those lectures that are really helpful. You\\'re in this program for a reason, and so are your classmates. Embrace your strengths just as you recognize and celebrate the strengths of others. Actually read through these tips instead of diving right into text mining/NLP for the TIPS project --- go for both to get the most out of the assignment Don\\'t be afraid to use the resources from school, counseling, coaching, meetings with faculty etc.. Just because it is a virtual environment doesn\\'t mean that you are bothering them by setting up appointments, don\\'t be afraid to reach out! Trust the process ;) Everything in this program is taught for a reason, don\\'t ignore anything. Absorb as much as you can. Get some blue light glasses if this online class thing is going to continue.  Some people will be better programmers than you, some people will have stronger mathematics backgrounds. Some people will have more job experience or more natural leadership skills. Do not waste your energy trying to compare yourself to others. You will have your own combination of skills, even if they\\'re not readily apparent to you, and they will make you unique and valuable and a great teammate.  Pay attention in Analytics in Practice lectures. Write down the names of the speakers, and keep track of main themes of their presentations (e.g. common words they use to describe their company culture). Those things will come in handy when you are applying for jobs and want to show interviewers you took the time to get to know their company.\\n\\nOne last quickie: Use SlidesGo or another similar site to find sweet slide decks and save yourself heaps of time. Some students prefer to take on as many interviews as possible but that can get exhausting and emotionally draining. Others apply for positions at places they know they would definitely work for. Keep an open mind, get to know what you want and what your goals are, and you\\'ll be well advised by the faculty/staff at the IAA. Make sure to really express interests in companies that you are interested in. Companies want to hire people that they think will accept the job. Network, Network and Network!!!..I can\\'t stress it enough! Take the coaching sessions seriously and use it as a platform to challenge yourself! The MSA coaches are so wise and it is such a wonderful resource!\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to reach out to alumni. I felt intimidated to do so while I was a student, but now that I am an alum of the program I would be so thrilled to have the chance to help a current student! So don\\'t hesitate to make meaningful connections with MSA alum! Make sure you schedule time in your day to get away from your computer and get some exercise. The program is extremely challenging and the mental break of exercising will help you recharge.  It can be really hard to build and maintain friendships virtually. Don\\'t beat yourself up if it\\'s difficult for you, but do try to make at least a friend or two.\\n\\nAs you start to see themes emerging in your peer feedback, working on any weaker areas is really worthwhile. \\n\\nGo to test prep study groups, or make one.\\n\\nThe summer project doesn\\'t have assigned roles for teammates, so it can be a little chaotic. Don\\'t get discouraged! Volunteer for tasks even if you\\'re not 100% sure how to do them, you\\'ll learn more. Trust the process is a real thing! Become familiar with Google Calendar as soon as possible. Subscribe to your teammates calendars, figure out how to attach zoom meetings to events, connect it with your Slack account, add notifications to your computer, install the app on your phone. You can also subscribe to your personal Google Calendar from your school one - unfortunately these events won\\'t show to your teammates, so you will need to copy them to your school calendar too if you don\\'t want meetings scheduled on top of them. Imposter syndrome will be addressed a lot, because it\\'s a huge thing in this expansive and difficult field. At some point, you will likely feel like you understand nothing, even after studying for months. For me, it was comforting to realize that most other students/practitioners barely understand the concepts themselves. To some degree, you will have to fake it \\'til you make it, and that is okay.  Take advantage of peer interviewing with friends or your practicum team members Sometimes things are better in foresight, than they are in hindsight so really sit down and actually read these TIPS. It\\'s a list of all the advice from past students of the program, students who went through the journey you\\'re about to embark. These TIPS will help you understand what\\'s to come and make the most of it. Good luck and trust the process!  Your classmates aren\\'t scary people! Really get to know them and build a good support system of peers-- they understand more than anyone else!  Don\\'t make a mess in the kitchen, especially in the microwave. If you do make a mess, clean it up or you will be publicly shamed. Grades really don\\'t matter-- what does matter is being a good teammate and getting a real understanding of the work you\\'re doing. As long as you focus on those things, you will come out of the program in great shape for a successful career in data science.\\n\\nThe faculty and staff at this program are amongst the best you\\'ll ever meet in your academic career. They are all incredibly knowledgable and amazing people-- get to know them. Learn from them. Ask questions.\\n\\nASK QUESTIONS-- to your classmates, to professors, and to alumni. You will learn so so much. It goes by fast, so try to sprinkle some fun in here and there.  It\\'s very easy to get sucked into homework teams, the practicum, and the job search. Make sure that you don\\'t say no to all social gatherings. You won\\'t be around this many great people again in your life. Make time for yourself. There is a lot to learn, there is a lot of work, and this will be difficult...but take time to love the things that you love. Play board games, go shoot hoops, go see a play. You will do better as your best self. Do not let ego or fear get in the way of speaking up. Go ahead and be wrong, ask \\'dumb\\' questions and put yourself out there. No one here is going to judge you as long as you are making an effort. It is likely that they are also feeling something similar as well even if it doesn\\'t seem that way. Make the effort to make friends early on! Finding your core group of friends is very helpful when getting through the tough times. Have fun, Challenge your self and make great relationships! Trust the process. I promise you\\'ll get sick & tired of hearing this but it\\'s SO true. There is a reason why this program & the alum are so successful -- the process works. It\\'s not easy, sometimes it\\'s stressful, some aspects may be unknown/confusing but ultimately the staff/faculty care so much about you & want nothing but for you to succeed. Take advantage of the support provided at the Institute & also of the alum (especially recent grads), we know what you\\'re going through & want to be as helpful as possible. (Also, for a fun task, if anyone\\'s up for it, start tallying how many times you hear \"Trust the process\" now & keep the tally going all 10 months. It\\'d be interesting to see how many times it\\'s actually said) Do not allow for homeworks and quizes to pile up during Fall semester. Try doing them on the day they are assigned or quickly after. There will be a lot going on in the Fall, so stay organized! Cancel Netflix till winter break ;)\\n\\nBe a great team member by offering help to others, volunteering for tasks (especially those you need to improve on), push yourself out of your comfort zone and taking initiate (do things nobody asked you for, but are needed). \\n\\nStart connecting with alumns early on, build relationships. It will be much easier to reach out to people during job search season. When you are tired everything is worse. SLEEP Make an account on StackOverflow so you can use the dark theme. Actually, use the dark theme whenever possible on your computer. People will think you\\'re a bad ass. :-) (in all seriousness, it\\'s a lot easier on your eyes...) Get to know your peers, especially your practicum team.  The support will help you get through those tough days Also, don\\'t be intimidated to talk to the faculty.  They are all incredibly friendly and are more than willing to help you in any way they can, even on side projects! Enjoy your time at the IAA. You do not need to become an expert in everything, but becoming well rounded in many of the fundamentals can take you a long way.  You will make it through Fall 3, your teams are there to help! Spring 1 was much harder for me. Keep your chin up during that time. Interviews can be taxing and there is almost no way to stay motivated to do practicum. Just keep powering through, all the capability you need is within you.  Indeed, the nights were long but they year was short. The MSA program is very challenging but I am so glad that I did it. I am sure that there is no other place quite like the Institute. The faculty are outstanding and the program is very well put together. Don\\'t sweat the small stuff and it\\'s all small stuff Go to the professor\\'s offices and ask questions! Also, save irrelevant questions for after class, not during!  Take advantage of the food and drink specials around town! Study your notes over winter break because you will be surprised how much you forgot come interview season. Socialize early with you practicum team, they will be your closest allies in the spring and don\\'t want to miss the opportunity to get to know them even more!  As you know, the MSA is an amazing program. What makes it incredibly amazing is your fellow students. Hang out, learn from each other, play sports/music/board-games together. These are people that will forever be in your network. Everyone is in the program for a reason, that means there are so many things out there that people know that will help you succeed in your future professional career.  We are not competing with each other at IAA. When you help others, in turn, they help you as well. Go to the bi-annual J.Crew Warehouse sale at the NC State Fairgrounds for new and very inexpensive business casual attire Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics are very in-demand yet rare skills. I happened to have a little bit of that background coming in and it really set me apart with employers, especially consulting firms.  Reach out to alumni. If they\\'re doing something you want to be doing, or you think they can help answer any questions -- ask them. Everyone is extremely happy to help in anyway. Don\\'t miss a happy hour hosted by an employer, even the ones that you are not particularly interested.  But keep in mind that these are potential employers, so keep an eye on your consumption.   Take time to make friends!!! Do some fun things with your groups. Life is better with people.  Have fun. Believe it or not, the program will fly by. Take the time to enjoy working alongside incredibly talented teammates in a wonderful program.   Talk to other students about everything. You\\'re never going through anything alone. 119 other people are doing the exact same thing. If you\\'re stressed about school, the job search, or your practicum, someone else is too, guaranteed. Try to identify solid confidants to talk to when things get tough, and to share exciting things with as well. The whole year is one big glass case of emotions. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy the experience, it goes by really fast! When you\\'re facing a problem on homework or in practicum, don\\'t go to the faculty as your first resource. Try to solve the problem on your own or with other members of your team (like you\\'ll have to do after the program). Only go to faculty members when you\\'ve hit a wall that you can\\'t get through. Be ready to learn about analytics and yourself during this program! Be nice and help your classmates.  Have fun! Take risks! Remember, no one is paying you yet- don\\'t be afraid to get creative and make mistakes!   Given the rigors of the course, it might be challenging, but try to have an outlet for dealing with stress. You need to be mentally and physically healthy for yourself, family, and teammates.  Treat this like a job. It is. Always put your best effort forward, no matter how much coffee it takes! This will not only help you succeed individually, but it will also help you to succeed as a team member. Nobody likes a team member that doesn\\'t pull his or her weight. This is more for international students studying in US for the first time: You might experience some cultural shocks and feel your english would never be good enough. Trust me, I was in your shoe, and it gets much better once you make it through the Fall semester. Hang in there! If you\\'re naturally more extroverted learn how to learn from introverts and vice versa Have a fantastic year! It will be intense. There will be crazy and stressful moments, but at the end of the day you will learn a lot about analytics, even more about yourself, and look back on the experience as an incredibly positive one. Never hesitate to ask for help Dr. LaBarr is an AMAZING instructor - learn everything you can from him! Everyone\\'s degree from this program is a team effort.  Get to know your teammates and get used to relying on them and having them rely on you for help.  Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and learning from others is as important as learning from your professors. For international students, start the OPT application early.'"
