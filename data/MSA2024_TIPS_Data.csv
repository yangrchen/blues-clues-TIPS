"prioritize life outside of the IAA so you don't get burnt out doing schoolwork all the time! hang out with friends, read books, go on walks, etc. this will help you be more productive in the long run because you're letting your brain and body have a break.",,"start the data visualization project way earlier than you think. in fact, start everything in Fall 2 as soon as you get it so you dont fall behind",,2023
"When they say ""trust the process,"" you actually should! The staff and faculty have been spent years perfecting the program from start to finish - they know what they are doing. Schedule meetings with the faculty if you need help or have any questions. Use all the resources they provide to you and participate in as many activities as you have time.","you are expected to maintain an A/B grade point average. Make ""cheat sheets"" to consolidate your notes that you can use to study or for quick references. Coding is a huge part of analytics, so do not rely on others to get coding portions of assignments done. Participate in every aspect of group projects to gain as much experience as you can. When it comes time for interviews, there will be technical coding questions. ","Fall 2 is the most stressful, fast-paced semester. Get ready for this. It gets easier from there.","Don't worry about the TIPS project so much. It's purpose is to see how well you work in teams and how creative you can be. Presentations get easier with time.  I do have some tips to prepare you for the interviews if you easily get nervous or anxious. They are fast-paced. After they ask you a question, if you need a chance to catch your breath, then ask them a question after you give your answer. They will speak for a little bit and take the pressure away from you, giving you some time to slow your heartrate. Come prepared with as many questions as possible - or even suggestions. This will demonstrate your interest. ",2023
" when you are interested in an analytic group or a company, network like crazy! Definitely try to talk to as many people as possible at the AIP and have real conversations with them (not just one question). To do this, find people who don't have a huge circle of people around them, or hang back until the last quarter of the networking session. Then, message anyone you talked to on LinkedIn later that day to thank them (reminding them of something you talked about during the session). Later, when it is closer to winter, reach out and have informational calls with MULTIPLE people from the group. Having connected multiple times before this point will increase the chance they will agree to have a video call with you. This technique was VERY helpful for me and I attribute my success in negotiating my salary after receiving an offer to this networking. It helps having people in the company who have extensively talked to you and already like you to be in your corner during the negotiation stage.
","If you are coming into the program after having industry experience, believe in the growth of your less-experienced classmates. During the summer session, you will definitely be in teams with at least one classmate with no real-world experience, and it may be frustrating, especially if they are coming in with a lot of false confidence (not knowing what they don't know). Do NOT write off these individuals for the whole program. You have an opportunity to share what you know with them, and you will also have a lot to learn in specific areas you don't expect, whether that is programming a language you haven't learned before or a niche analytics technique. Also, I have seen these same individuals grow immensely throughout the program. It is really awesome to see people improve over time and by the end it really feels they can communicate and work alongside you as a colleague. So early on, be helpful and patient! If you are coming into the program as a student with no real-world experience, be humble and know that there is a lot to still learn outside of the technical, even if you were a total rockstar in undergrad!","Depending on your cohort, you may or may not make those amazing friends you might hear about in other TIPs. If you find your besties in the program, amazing! If you find a lot of connections and future analytical colleagues, also amazing! ","Put your mental health and relationships, above the Institute, always. Health and relationships will persist while the Institute of Advanced An-al-yt-ics is temporary. Prioritizing with intention is beyond important!",2023
"Take good care of yourself. Getting adequate sleep, going for a walk, or taking time to reset can help you stay active and energized during the program.","Don't be shy to ask the faculty, classmates, TAs, or alumnus for help - seriously, people from the IAA are some of the nicest and most helpful people I've ever met! Also, remember to keep this in mind: ""trust the process.""",Hang out with your classmates during lunch or class break. You will make some awesome new friends who you can learn from and grow together!,"It's useful to have prior knowledge of Python and Tableau before starting the program, and if you're interested, you can also start exploring analytical concepts, such as Natural Language Processing or Deep Neural Networks",2023
"Analyzing data is hard. It is complicated, convoluted, and downright confusing at times. You may not have time to know everything and dive deep into why some methodologies work. That's okay. You will not master the 10+ topics you cover over the year, but the faculty will prepare you to have a broad overstanding into the main concepts of each topic. If you are interested in learning more about a certain analytical method, doing a side project is an excellent way to deepen your knowledge and have something to talk about during your job interview process.","The days are long, but the months are short. Being at school from 9 to 4 and then going home, still needing to take care of your other life, and still needing to do school work is tiring. You will fork over so much time to this program. There will be days where you want to throw in the towel and give up. Just keep trudging forward and talk to someone and get help if you need to. Time will start to fly by and before you realize it, you'll be done with the program. You may be skeptical (I was at the start too), but have faith and trust in yourself to get through the program. You'll get out just fine. ","Give everything your best. Do anything and everything you can to do well. You will fail, but that's okay. Learn from it and grow. At the start of the program, I thought I would never do well and that I would be way in over my head. For the first few weeks, I felt like that. As time went on, I found what my strengths were and always brought those to the table to contribute. From there, I could focus on what I was weak on to make myself a well-rounded data scientist.",,2023
"If you ever forget your lunch at home, consider eating at the On the Oval Dining Hall instead of the food trucks. They can be pretty expensive. ","Make sure that you always book study rooms ASAP if you need a space for you or your team, especially until the end of Spring 1. After Spring 1, the building isn't as full most days so it's easier to get space. ","You are more analytically minded than you give yourself credit for. It's unlikely you will feel comfortable with the whole curriculum and that's okay! Seek third party feedback and utilize provided coaching, counseling, and career development resources to define your own meaning of success and happiness.","Soak up all of the analytics, communication, and career knowledge that you can this year! It can feel overwhelming at times, but I feel much more prepared to be a data scientist now than I did a year ago. ",2023
"Discover and analyze your learning style and routine. How you learn is just as important as what you learn, so take the time in summer and early fall to find a system that works well for you!",Broaden your view on the field of analytics. Data science is found in every industry and there's a place for every skill learned during the curriculum. Do some research about which sound interesting and short list 3 to explore more in depth.,,,2023
"For some reason, a lot of people think it's necessary to scare you about how busy things get when you're in the program. You may hear things like ""say goodbye to your friends and family for a year,"" or ""cancel Netflix because there's no such thing as free time,"" or ""sleep is going to be hard to come by."" Although the program is strenuous and will require you to work beyond your comfort zone, statements intended to scare you are oftentimes exaggerated, and sometimes, downright untrue. If your family and friends are important to you, you will be able to make the time to see them. If Netflix is important to you, there's plenty of downtime as long as you budget your time responsibly. If sleep is important to you, there's plenty of time to consistently get a good night's rest. Remember that things aren't going to be half as bad as people say they are as long as you work hard and stay on top of things, ","I could write something generic like ""get to know your classmates,"" but I think it goes much deeper than that. By design, the IAA is a very diverse group of people. This is no accident. You will work closely with personalities that are different from yours, and even more surprising, people who have no interest in wanting to do things the way you want them done. Notice your classmates' personalities, and take note of what works and what doesn't work with them. Once you graduate, reflect on the many different types of people you've worked with and how to handle them, and take the same approach with your coworkers as you start/continue your professional career. Learning to be more emotionally intelligent now will provide you with so many advantages in the future.","The practicum project is an incredible experience, but knowing that you have to spend the next eight months closely working with the same people on a unique project can be daunting. I remember dreading the conflict that would inevitably arise when my team was first assigned. I was right; there was definitely healthy conflict over the course of our project. However, as long as the conflict is for the group's benefit, situations like these tend to blow over very quickly. There was once in particular when I was afraid a certain situation would derail our progress, but surprisingly, it worked itself out very quickly after openly communicating with each other. Whenever conflict arises, be sure to 1) see the situation for what it is, 2) openly and honestly communicate with each other, and most importantly, 3) MOVE ON. Nothing in this program is worth holding a grudge over.",,2023
"Grades DO matter. It's okay if you get a poor grade on an assignment here or there, but you'll be expected to maintain a GPA. Do not slack off in your classes!","Some of you will make close friends in the program. Some of you won't. And that's okay. Remember that when you are reading these tips that say you're going to make lifelong friends, the people who wrote them have only known each other for 10 months. They do not know if they will be lifelong friends. Focus on being a good teammate and a kind person, and don't worry about where your relationships with your classmates will be years from now.",Learn SQL. Most of our technical interviews involved SQL this year. ,Talk with the faculty. They're great!,2023
Ask your classmates for help and be ready to listen,"Make the most of your time in the program. It's only 10 months, but it will feel like 2 years. Make some friends with your classmates and try to get out your comfort zone a little bit.",,,2023
"Be sure to get into a routine early on within the summer, as you will greatly thank yourself later. The workload really picks during the fall semester and having this routine will help to maximize your learning and limit the stress of the program.","If you are struggling with any content during the program, ask for help! You are surrounding by faculty, staff, and peers that all want to see you succeed. Do not let the fear of being wrong limit your learning.",Be sure to build connections with your classmates early and often. You are surrounding by great people who are all learning the same things you are. These are the people you will be able to lean on for support.,,2023
"Comment your code with the procedural or analytical thought processes. With complex modeling procedures, it can be difficult to remember why certain chunks of code are being used. As you are learning things in class, comment your code with why this concept/test/step is necessary and how it fits into the big picture. ","Learn the material, apply your skills, and focus on soaking up the concepts and experience. If you are diligent with your time and have a natural curiosity to learn and further your analytical tool belt, the grades will follow. ","Stop stressing in general. You're all smart and capable, you wouldn't be in the room otherwise. You're going to be fine. It will likely be overwhelming and tiring sometimes, but so is life, what's new? It will be over before you know it, so do yourself a favor and just relax. ",,2023
Take care of your mental health!  ,Make sure to attempt any analysis homework using both R and Python so you have experience using both programming languages! ,"Make sure to spend time with your friends, family, and classmates outside of the institute! Maintaining these relationships will keep you sane!",,2023
"""Trust the process"" means doing your best on the tasks IAA encourages you to do, in the right order and at the right time. During the Summer and Fall terms, focus on building solid technical skills (regularly summarizing critical points for technical interviews), engaging in teamwork (saving stories for behavioral questions), and networking with alums and industry experts.","Networking is about learning how different industries utilize analytics (e.g., models, programming languages, cloud computing, business context, etc.) and exploring the career paths of others. This will help you identify your own career goals and preferences. Taking notes during AIPs on the company's current goals, challenges, and how you may contribute to it will prove useful for future interviews. Remember, networking is not to land a job through 30-minute coffee chats.","Be confident but humble. You are here because you have something valuable to bring to the table, just like everyone else. Don't compare yourself with others, but be aware of your strengths and weaknesses that you may discover through teamwork, and learn how to improve them from your teammates. Improving my self-awareness was the most valuable thing I gained during my time in the IAA.",,2023
"Read your textbooks. They have so much analytics insights and go beyond what is discussed in class. The early part of the summer is definitely the best time to make some new friends and learn to play ping pong. Bring your own fork.
","
When the career people say to network early and often, they mean it! Don't wait until January. You will have technical interviews starting in January! Use that free datacamp to add to your analyticall skills. The python certification is straightforward. Don't put it off. Do it in the fall.  
","You will feel busy. Be busier and redo some of your analysis assignments in Python and make a github of your work. When someone asks for code samples, you will be ready. Work on being a better team member every week. Listen actively. Plan ahead. Use your calendar and look at the calendars of others. Schedule your personal time (e.g. gym) when it is least likely to impact team work especially if you have commuters or people with children on your team.  Combat your monachopsis by upskilling and being a kind and talented contributor to your groups.

"Make friends with or be friendly to everyone. While the point of the program is not to make friendships, it is a great added bonus. You are surrounded by this group of people all day every day in classes, homework teams, practicum, etc. You get friendly with them very quick and they become your support system. Lean on them. But more importantly, develop a friendly relationship with as many people as possible. Don't just find a good few in the first week and stick only to them. I really appreciated talking to everyone and having a wide array of connections and supporters. ","Find a faculty member you connect with and trust. That may be your coach, it may be a technical faculty member, or Dr. West, or Dr. Egan Warren. They're all here to help you and offer advice. Find one who you connect with and lean on them when necessary. While I developed a great relationship with my coach, I also had a candid relationship with Dr. Eagan Warren and found myself seeking her advice quite often as well especially with practicum. ","If you're interested in doing a side project, do it in the Fall. If you're planning on getting certifications, finish them by January. In the Spring, you become very busy with juggling interviews, practicum, and class work. You won't have time for much else on your plate. And once you have a job secured, it becomes a race to graduation.","Give yourself a break even when you think you can't afford one. I pulled many late nights both in the Fall and the Spring. However, I found myself working almost every waking hour in the Fall. Retrospectively, I probably had workaholic tendencies but at the time it felt very necessary given the work load and being a team lead. My body couldn't sustain that same momentum come Spring. I gave myself a lot more breaks to eat a proper dinner, spend more time with family, and just plain relax. If you're a workaholic like me you know how difficult that is to do, but it is very crucial to physical and mental health as well. ",2023
"I Won't Back Down -- Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (1989)

This is the mindset you need to be successful here at the Institute. There will be long days and nights of work. You need grit and perseverance. ","Serenade -- Steve Miller Band (1976)

Don't let the stress and anxiety associated with deadlines and deliverables dominate the narrative in your head about the institute and your experience here. Take moments to reflect and enjoy the experience. Connect with your peers and professors. ","Sharp Dressed Man -- ZZ Top (1983)

You might want an extra set of business formal clothes. During portions of the fall semester I was wearing the same suit very often, up to 3-4 times in a week. Maybe just an extra pair of pants to go with the same jacket. ",,2023

It will help you grow,  Analyze your weaknesses so you can address them, and the best part is that it will help you know all the amazing things you do have to offer.",ALWAYS BYOF (bring your own fork)! Prove this analysis wrong! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322240/,"Be wise about managing your time.

That is where the best growth happens. ,2023
"Be fully invested in all the work of the program. All of the classes, workshops, projects, and events contribute something valuable to your growth as an analytics professional, and putting intentional effort and focus in will help you get the most out of it!",Don't be afraid to try different things in your Practicum project. Often times an interesting idea and different approach can reveal unexpected things about the problem and lead to more insights. Applying different methods of analysis outside your comfort zone is also a great way to learn even more while doing the Practicum!,"Make sure to keep up with your schedule for interviews, practicum and homework team work, classes, and some social time as well during the Spring. Keep your calendar updated, with study blocks or work sessions too if that helps you, and stick to it. Your teammates will thank you, and you will be better prepared for interviews when you have a plan for what is coming!",,2023
"There's going to be a lot of tips focusing on how stressful the program will be, and the need to prepare for the heavy workload ahead. The program will be stressful, and there will be a lot of work. But don't let this overwhelm you. If you manage your time wisely, you will still have time for doing the things that you enjoy. The ten months ahead will be difficult but they can be a lot of fun too. ",,"Enjoy the summer and use your free time early on to form relationships with your peers in the program. Also, don't stress out too much about this TIPS assignment. It's just an opportunity to get comfortable working together and starting to analyze data. ",,2023
"The first and most important thing to remember is that you are at the IAA for a reason and your qualifications and skills have brought you there. Don't question that throughout the process, even if you feel like people around you are smarter or better at coding, etc. Keep learning and taking in as much as you can, be a good teammate, do your share of work, and you will be a successful IAA student.","The job search can definitely be an emotionally challenging time. It can be quite difficult observing other people getting interviews for a job that you also applied for. You will hear this A LOT, but you never know the reasons why you were not chosen to proceed with a certain interview or position, and there might be a number of external factors playing into this decision of a company. The most important thing to do is to move on from those experiences quickly and to focus on the next interview in front of you.  Also, remember that AIPs are an opportunity to network, however,  I would recommend also focusing on actually learning about each company, as the AIPs are a great opportunity to learn about the work done at each company, but also things like work-life balance and culture.",,,2023
"Try to fight procrastination as much as you can. There are a lot of things to keep track of during the program, and it can be burdensome when you procrastinate small tasks and suddenly it becomes overwhelming. Try to do your assignments when they're assigned, not when they're due. This might be the best productivity hack for this program - at least for me, it was much more effective than making to do lists all the time. The things on your to do list don't go away unless you knock them out. It's better to simplify things!","This program is a great opportunity to develop your time management skills. Use it as an opportunity to get to know more about yourself - what kind of environment do you work best in? How much sleep/rest do you need to be fully or somewhat functional? What is the best way to learn a new subject - studying alone? With others? Knowing how you can be most productive and efficient when you're under time constraints and pressure will be useful in the real world, when you become an analytics professional.","Trust the process. Focus on the growth mindset. Utilize coaching as much as you can! Reach out to your peers and faculty when you are struggling. Realizing that you need help, and asking for help will be a valuable skill when you become an analytics professional.","I recommend consolidating all your class notes into documents so that it will be easy for you to find the information you want after you graduate. It'll be difficult to know everything perfectly during the program, so creating this collection of documents will be handy when you're on the job. It's almost impossible to try to do this for all the courses at once. So try to do it a little at a time, when you're taking the course.",2023
"Make time to step away from the program and focus on enjoying rest, friends & family, or anything else that helps you recharge your battery. The busyness of the program comes in waves, so create a schedule that allows you to take time for your mental health no matter where your schedule stands.",The days feel long but the months go by quick! Enjoy the point of the program you are at and don't get too worried about what is to come.,"Expand your analytical skillset as much as possible. Although it may feel uncomfortable, take advantage of the program's resources and faculty to try out a new language/skill.

"Take the time to form friendships during the summer and Fall 1! Things really pick up afterward and you don't have as much free time to get to know your classmates, especially those placed in the other cohort, so try to socialize up front. Your classmates will be a wonderful support system for you throughout the process. Everyone is going through the program and facing similar struggles, so don't miss out on the opportunity to form enduring genuine connections. You are each others cheerleaders!","If you are struggling with an analytical concept or a homework assignment and aren't making progress figuring it out by yourself, ask for help as soon as possible. You can schedule a meeting time with an instructor or the statistics TA, and they are also available via e-mail or slack. Your classmates are also a good resource for clearing up concepts when instructors are not available. This program moves very quickly, so if you get stuck on something, use every resource possible to clarify it quickly so you don't start falling behind.","Start reaching out to alumni for informational interviews in the fall! The internal and external job search process in spring ramps up very quickly, and it may become difficult to make time for informal meetings on top of applying for jobs, prepping for interviews, and completing class assignments. Try to make a note of what companies you are most interested in and reach out to alumni working there. Be sure to ask what kinds of skills make a good candidate for that particular company or industry, this is super helpful information to have when preparing for interviews!",,2023
"Every day, write down three highlights from the Institute. If you don't know where to begin, focus on both interactions and significant transitions—like unanticipated lunch conversations and starting new classes, respectively. I have hundreds of memories and quotes cataloged that I love to share with my now great friends. Even on rough days, find three gems! ",Take full advantage of all coaching and counseling resources. I have learned as much about myself as I have about analytics in the past 10 months. You're likely to spend a lot of time second-guessing yourself as an IAA student; you might as well learn why you do that in the first place. ,"This year, the general consensus of my peers was that Spring 1 was by far the most stressful semester. April often asserts, ""getting a job is a job."" I'd take that further and say, ""getting a job is a really hard and emotionally defeating job."" Try to be particularly mindful of any mood or attitude changes that you experience during the job hunt. There's a lot of jealousy, embarrassment, and guilt that goes around. Be honest with yourself and your coach, counselor, and friends outside of the Institute about how you're feeling. Then, when you're ready, get back on track and secure that bag! ",,2023

You can always process any of this with your coach, they are there for you!",Putting in the work and long nights in the summer/fall leads to a much calmer spring. Interview prep will be less stressful if you do the heavy lifting earlier in the year.,"Make friends through the whole process! Some of my closest friends I didn't make until Spring 2.

,"During December break, I would suggest to focus on learning the concepts from Fall. Lot of interview questions are based on that. Also, study A/B testing as that is a very common interview question. I would prioritize content review and then side project then certifications. ",,,2023
"[Summer tip] Imposter syndrome is a common theme amongst all students. It's ok if you come in with less knowledge of coding/stats - you'll re-use and practice everything you've learned in class! You'd be surprised that many students come in being code novices and might be coding leads for a homework team in the fall or spring! You may feel a little lost initially but follow the classes, take notes (ex. oneNote, notion, thousands of apps), review, and DON'T be afraid to ask for help from classmates or professors. The first few presentations may seem scary, but I promise you'll appreciate it later! A Tips project hint - be creative and try everything! ","[Fall tip] I'm not going to sugarcoat it... Fall was the hardest module for me. The material was tough, and something was due every other day. Fall 1 & 2 focuses on lecture and lecture-based projects, while Fall 3 is preparing for your practicum midpoint review. Manage your time wisely and keep track of deadlines on your google calendar or phone! My practicum team felt we were slower than others but try not to hyper-focus on the comparisons. Just focus on your work, and the faculty will be happy with the effort you've put in! Contact the faculty if you run into any trouble during the practicum coding! They were the most useful resources! During AIPs, try to network with at least one person and give out your business card whenever you can!","[Spring tip] Spring will feel significantly different after the beast that is the Fall module. Lectures will be more spread apart, as well as deadlines. Friends, don't let friends forget about quizzes! We had many students slack in the general chat when something was due, which was a great reminder. The end of January through the first week of March will be interview season. Pay attention during all of Kate & April's career classes. You'll feel like you're competing with all your classmates to get jobs but don't get upset if you're not given an offer. The recruiting process can be complicated, and someone may get chosen because they seem like a better fit. Don't take this personally - the program has prepared you to be a strong candidate everywhere you go, and you will be the right fit for another company. Look for jobs externally, along with your internal interviews!

The personal and professional network will be something that you will continue to use throughout your analytics career.","Everyone will talk about how hard Fall 2 is, but be prepared for how mentally draining Spring 1 will be. You will have a lot more free (unscheduled) time, but you will need to manage it wisely with everything going on.

I don't regret any of the various outings I attended. ","Be realistic about your learning. With such an accelerated program, you won't be able to become an expert in these topics. Think of it as building the analytical foundation you'll use as a jumping-off point at the next step in your career. ","Build pockets of fun wherever you can. Choose an exciting side project or subject for the text analytics project. Go to Brandon's game nights. Do the intramural sports teams (even if you're not ""good""). Bring a ball to toss around outside during breaks with other students. Take a weekend trip. Enjoy yourself! ",You're here for a reason. You can do this. You've got this. ,2023
"If you have little to no prior experience with coding, focus on a single resource for Python and SQL. Spend 30 minutes a day in the Summer for these as it will immensely help during Fall and Spring. Getting better at data analysis using these tools will help you stand out in the industry and the overall job market. 
The faculty in the program are simply exceptional and always willing to help.","The career services team is fantastic, and take their advice seriously. When they say ""trust the process"", they've done the data analysis to back it up. Never hesitate to reach out to Kate and April for advice or just sharing your wins in the job search process - they'll be the happiest to hear about it.","If you're an international student, make the most of what your classmates have to offer. You'll be surrounded by some of the brightest minds around, so learn from them and share what you've learned in the past - collaboration over competition always helps. Lastly, find a buddy (or two) in the program who'll be with you through thick and thin. Build a couple friendships in class that you'll cherish for the rest of your life. ",,2023

Work on a side project throughout the fall semester. They help with your comprehension of the material and with interviews.,,"Trust the process overall, but make sure to pursue external job leads and find your favorite area to contribute in group work and make that known in interviews. If you are really good at presenting technical information in an understandable way try to find clever ways to bring that up in interviews and showcase your strengths.",,2023
"Make friends in the program during the Summer term. If you are a very outgoing person, make an additional effort to get to know your classmates who are more reserved. It can be lonely for a lot of people.","Attend the weekly Improv classes starting in the Fall. At least try it out once. It's an opportunity to practice communication and presenting skills, including spontaneity, creativity, patience, and the all-important skill of keeping your cool when your scene partner says something ridiculous.","Become friends with the people on your Practicum team. At least get to know who they are outside of an academic and professional setting. This might look like doing things as a group outside of classes and meetings, such as going for a walk around campus between classes or getting together at someone's house for dinner. You'll work together more effectively if you've made the effort to become acquainted and you actually like your teammates.",,2023
,"As you are working on your practicum project it's never a bad idea to ask yourself, ""how would I talk about this in a job interview?""",Listen to the staff and faculty. When faculty give you feedback on your practicum deliverables listen to them. When April and Kate tell you to do something listen to them. They are the experts and they really do have your best interests at heart.,,2023
"The program is only 10 months - give it your all for that time! This doesn't mean that it should dominate your entire life. Still maintain balance with your social life, stay active, do things for fun, etc., but also don't be afraid to go above and beyond or spend extra time on things that you think may set you apart. Do the side project you were considering embarking on, and document it thoroughly. Put in the extra time re-watching lectures or studying notes on that one concept that you know is important but you were kind of confused on. Send the LinkedIn messages and schedule the informational interviews with your connections at prospective employers. None of these things are required, but they will all be incredibly valuable in the hiring process, whether it's establishing a connection, giving you something great to talk about in an interview, or making sure you're secure on any technical concept they could ask about. Doing things like this will maximize your chances of success come spring.","Fully invest yourself in your practicum project by making sure you understand every aspect of it, even those where you may not be the most active participant. As someone with no prior work experience (fresh out of undergrad), I talked about the practicum an unbelievable amount in job interviews as it basically functions as my entire analytical work experience. The practicum project is a full, industrial scale, end-to-end analytics project experience, so even if you have worked before, it is incredibly valuable for employers to hear about in interviews. As such, make sure your mastery of every part of the project is not just good, but great, detailed, and specific. Everything from the technical methodology, scoping of the problem, communication with client/stakeholders/sponsor, teamwork and leadership, deliverables, etc. will be important talking points in interviews, so lean on the practicum as a tool that you know you can talk about endlessly!","Develop relationships with your classmates. The program is intensive and difficult, but you will have an entire body of students going through it alongside you. Developing personal relationships with your classmates will make the experience much more enjoyable. For me, I was very close with my practicum teammates and some others, and just having people to joke around with, bounce ideas off of, go out and decompress with, etc. was really valuable.",,2023
You have unique skills that make you a wonderful student and future employee. Remember that!. You are capable of completing the program. The institute chose you to be in the program for a reason. Knowing this can bring confidence to team work and job interviews.,"Put effort into creating lifelong relationships among classmates and faculty. This includes attending activities with classmates, having a conversation with someone you have talked much, setting up time with faculty for support (P.S. they are amazing), and attending the optional classes/get togethers you are interested in. ","Get work done early and establish an organization system. The institute does a great job setting you up with a few tools to keep you on track such as moodle and google calendar. However, you need to plan your days and weeks well to make the most out of the limited time you have. I would also recommend taking good notes during the year that you can reference for tests, job interviews, and ultimately your job.",Communicate often with you practicum and homework teams. Over communication is rarely a problem. Your teams will love it if they hear from you often. ,2023
"This may be the most cliche statement ever (and you've probably already read this 100+ times), but, truly, the days are long but the year is short. This program does cover a LOT in a short amount of time, and some days can really feel like they drag on forever. But I can promise you that what you learn here is incredibly valuable from an employment standpoint, the student body is so diverse and fun, and it will be over sooner than you know it. So enjoy (and trust!) the process, spend time with your fellow classmates, and make the most of these short ten months :)",,"Don't hesitate to re-watch the lectures. If you missed class or just want to get a refresher on some of the analytics concepts, utilize the Panopto recordings! I and many of my classmates found it to be really beneficial to re-watch the lectures soon and well in advance of any exams/presentations.",,2023

"It is okay if you don't make close friends in this program right away! I didn't become close friends with my classmates until Fall 2, and that is perfectly okay. Sometimes the best relationships just take a little longer to develop.","As I'm sure you know, coding is an incredibly important skill in the job market. Practice over the summer while you still have time. When the fall starts up, try coding your homework assignments yourself, even if other people in your HW team are assigned to do it. ",,,2023
"Do your certifications as early as you can, it only gets harder to make time for them as the year goes on.","A note for impostor's syndrome: if you made it into the program, that means you already have 90% of what it takes to get your master's degree and a job afterwards.

"Maintain perspective. The program is short, be willing to make short term sacrifices and it feel less overwhelming.",Use Python regularly. Python appeared most often during my job search.,Networking is not as fake and gross as you expect. Most conversations surprised me with how genuine they were. It also will make you much more comfortable during interviews.,,2022
"Don't worry about what the hardest part of the program is; it's all hard up until maybe halfway through Spring 2. But do keep in mind that the job search hits you HARD coming out of your winter break. If I were to go back again, I would have focused on my interview prep (doing coding challenges (SQL + Python), practicing detailing my practicum, explaining machine learning, reading through my Ace the Data Science Interview book) during the tail end of the winter break. Do give yourself a solid break, but maybe give yourself five days before the break ends to start interview prep. ","Enjoy yourself and make friends early and often. Once you get back from winter break, everyone will already be in friend groups and it can be hard to branch out then. If it weren't for the great friendships and camaraderie with my teams, the stress would have been overbearing. ","Lastly, do make time to see friends and family outside of the program. Sometimes its good to get a break from the IAA stress bubble to recenter your perspective and relax more. Everyone at the IAA is always going to be talking about HW, side projects, certs, or jobs and it can add to your stress at times. If you feel that, it's time to see the world outside of the IAA a bit!",,2022

"Exercise. This program will be time consuming and often the last thing you will feel like doing is working out, but I promise even just a 10 minute workout (there are so many good videos on youtube!) will leave you feeling healthier and refreshed to keep going. And when you inevitably get side tracked and realize you stopped working out, forgive yourself and just start again. Your body and mind will thank you.","There are a lot of great resources in this program, but two of the absolute gems are Joe and April. Please...and I cannot stress this enough...work with them!! Especially for counseling, at minimum do the intake appointment so that whenever you decide you want to start counseling you are ready to go.","Build a community of friends. I saw this one a lot when I was reading the tips and didn't really understand what it meant until I went through the program. This program is hard and its only harder if you try to do it on your own. Your friends are yes, social and emotional support, but in this program working with friends will make you a better student. The truth is you don't know everything (sorry) and you will benefit from working with people that have different strengths and skillsets. It is so much easier to thrive in this program when you have a group of friends to study with, work on homework assignments together, and practice interviewing with.",DONT write off anyone and BE NICE to everyone. This is a tight network and you never know when that person you couldn't stand on your HW team is your only connection at your dream company. You don't want a burned bridge to stop you from reaching your goals.,2022
Focus on prioritization. You won't have enough time to put 100% effort into everything. Focus on the things that are most essential first and don't beat yourself up if you didn't perform perfectly at everything.,"Do a lot of informational interviews in the Fall. Not only will it help you land a job, but you will get great advice for getting through the program. Don't be afraid to ask about the things you want to know. Alumni usually love giving advice and giving you information that they wished they knew when they were in your shoes.","Focus on learning, NOT grades.

BUT, if you work better with a schedule and struggle with unstructured time/last minute plans then Spring 1 will probably be more stressful for you. Interviews will come out of no where. There could be days where you aren't sure if you have an interview tomorrow until 7pm that night. Try to keep your schedule as free as possible during the blocked off interview times. ","Once you get your practicum teams in the Fall, someone from each team will have the ""Program Liaison"" role. It may seem like a minor role but the faculty and Dr. Rappa actually really value the input from this role. This person should be an active voice and not afraid to speak up. Listen to your teammates and represent them in the best way possible. Inform your teammates of all the decisions being made to avoid confusion when changes could be made. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for literally anything (the worst they can say is no).",,,2022

Go out on a limb and ask people if they want to hang out, get food/drinks, or play some pickup sports.","The IAA staff and faculty are truly here to support you -- everyone genuinely wants you to succeed. Reach out if you are struggling, stressed, or want some guidance. April and Kate (professional services) are gems. Reach out to them with any concerns.

"Take the initiative. If there is something you want to learn, or figure out, don't wait for it to be taught to you. Go learn about it, consult faculty and staff, ask questions, and use external resources. This is especially true for the practicum but also for any subject matter, academic or professional. You should try to take the initiative wherever possible, even in your career and in your life to achieve the outcomes you are hoping for.","Think critically about what you want to learn and achieve from this program continuously reevaluate. This will allow you to be more selective in how to budget your time and efforts because it is not sustainable to be a master at everything. 
	
Setting goals and calibrating your approach to best achieve your goals will help you both as a student and in the job search. You cannot give maximum effort towards every company, so think about which companies and industries may be more important to you. More targeted Networking will bear more fruit
	
If you have multiple job offers, think critically about what are your short term, medium term, and long term professional goals are and which opportunity will best help you get there. Salaries will normalize eventually but experiences learned may not.","Make the job search process your own and don't be afraid to be unorthodox, cast a wide net, and reach out to external companies.

OneNote will help you store all important things quickly. A one stop searchable shop for your brain. Lifesaver.","I would say again to use OneNote, but I won't. Learn to work efficiently. If you pay attention during class you won't have to re-watch lecture videos later like everyone else and it will save you a ton of time.","Use OneNote. Also, try to do some assignments (or at least a side project) in python.

"I remember being anxious about who my sponsor company was, despite Dr. Rappa emphasizing that it doesn’t really matter at the end of the day. And he was absolutely right- your practicum team is what makes the experience! You’ll spend so much time with them that they become like family. Plus, the industry your practicum is in has no bearing on where you’ll work. My practicum was for a consulting company, and my team members got jobs in sports analytics, tech, financial services, and national security. ","You’ll hear it a million times, but trust the process! Put in the work in the summer and fall, and you’ll get where you need to in the spring. This program works, you just have to believe in it (and yourself)!","This is probably all over TIPS, but the people in this program are some of the best you’ll ever meet. I have made some of my best friends here, so much so that I’ll be living with some of them after graduation. This isn’t your typical grad program where everyone’s cooped up all day— we all work hard, but know our limits and how to have fun! From our class’ epic Halloween party to Tuesday trivia takeovers at Sammy’s to our post-graduation class beach trip, we’ve made some great memories and I know this upcoming class will too! ","Start early with preparing for the job search process! You’ll do a mock interview with an alumni in December, but don’t stop there until the process kicks up again in February. I suggest taking winter break as a break (don’t burn yourself out), but come back strong in early January. I formed a study group with some people where we did four hour sessions around two times a week studying and interviewing each other. It really paid off because all of us got job offers pretty early on!",2022
"Don't feel like a loser if classmates are advancing in interviews and you're not. Your time and fit will come.

Focus on learning, improving your soft skills, and remember that everything you are doing as part of this program is there for a reason. ","Take the actual break during the winter break but start preparing for the interviews. Once you get back from the break, the interviews begin right away, and you might have multiple interviews in one day for different companies. Once you get a list of past behavioral and technical questions from April before the winter break, start writing down your answers to have them ready on time. Also, write notes after every module, maybe even once a week, with the most important concepts to remember. This will come in handy in your preparation for the interviews. ","Time flies in this program, so make sure to get the best of it in terms of learning, practicing your soft skills, preparing for real-world and cultural differences in the work environment, and making friendships.","Job search is a stressful period, and just try your best to prepare for it, but remember that there is also a lot of luck to it. If you get rejections or are not invited for the first round of interviews, it can be for various reasons. The companies are looking for different things, sometimes, your goals do not match, but it does not mean that you are doing anything wrong. If that happens, talk to April and Kate, practice the interview with them, and review your resume and cover letter. They are there to help you. ",2022
"Be sure to build a fitness routine into your schedule. Group Fitness classes are a great free way to destress! My favorites were cardio step, cycle, yoga, and hip hop. I also took aggressively long walks around Lake Raleigh, and did Kathy/ Joe's Koru meditation class. You do have time if you make it a priority.","Take out books from the IAA library!

Some see that they don't have classes half of the week and don't take advantage of that extra time, causing them to be more anxious about not having as many interviews or an offer towards the end of the module. Others go for every job opportunity they see, causing them to have 7-10 interviews a week which stresses them out.

"You will often hear the mantra 'Trust the Process,' and it is important to trust that the faculty at the IAA know what to do to set you up for success. However, it is equally, if not more, essential to value the process. It is easy to fixate on the results, from how you did on a test to if you got a job or not. All the work you put in and the growth you experience are valuable. What you do along the way matters, and it is important not to lose sight of that.","Focus on your goals and path. You are in a program filled with smart and talented people, and you will be tempted to compare yourselves to others. However, you should make sure you focus on what you want to get out of the program and what your goals are. This helps reduce that fixation with what others are doing and feeling behind. Setting up SMART goals for yourself and planning when you want to get a certification or how many jobs to apply to in a given will help you focus on your path and less so on the path of others.","Take advantage of the resources at the IAA! The coaching, counseling, faculty guidance, and technical resources you get at the IAA are tremendous, and you have them at your disposal. Use these resources to help develop your technical and soft skills and maintain your mental well-being. The IAA is a community that you remain a part of once you graduate, but you should take advantage of the resources provided while you are there. ","Develop a routine! You will be busy during your time at the IAA, and having a routine can help you develop some structure as you navigate that workload. It helps you avoid being overwhelmed and prevents that feeling of scrambling to get things done. 

Embrace the 'suck.' The IAA will be challenging and stressful, but that is ok. The faculty know the program is a demanding experience, and there are times you might feel overwhelmed or feel tested by the experience. However, that is normal, and it is ok to embrace that experience. That is not to say you should bottle up all that stress and anxiety, but rather that you should accept those feelings are present and try and do something to address them.

A lot of the work that you will do at the Institute will be in teams and the work load overall begins to ramp up in the fall, so the summer is the perfect time to go to social events. Doing something fun with your classmates also gives you the opportunity to focus on something outside of work which is usually much needed after demanding ends to each of the modules. ",,,2022

","Greet people as they walk past in the hallways or in class, even if you don’t normally talk with them. ",,2022
"Network hard right NOW. While it is very much likely that your networking may not yield a way into a job, use those opportunities to learn about different industries, and establish contacts with people you may want to hit up later in your career. The difficult part is continuing contact beyond the first call, so work on trying to socially engage if you can.","Research financial literacy (maybe kill 2 birds with one stone and do a side project on investing, etc.) so you know what you really need to do for your long-term financial goals.","Don't neglect balancing your speaking and writing skills. Oral presentations are typically more intimidating for most people and so are worked on more frequently, but be sure to keep your writing at the same level.",,2022
"Career services gives lots of suggestions on how to network in the fall, and they are all great tips (many people get interviews with certain companies solely because they reached out to them on LinkedIn and had a chat). Treat networking as a required part of the program and force yourself to reach out - even if you're extremely anxious and nervous (like I was). It was extremely valuable to learn how to talk to professionals that you don't know and a lot of my success in interview season came from how comfortable I was in those situations because I networked a lot. Besides, eventually your nerves will subside as you become more comfortable with the process. ",Be vulnerable with your classmates. It helped me so much to hear about how classmates (who I really respect) struggle with anxiety and imposter syndrome just like I did. It is very cathartic to vent with classmates who know exactly what you're going through. ,,,2022

"You will work incredibly hard during this program, but make sure to take some time to relax and reset. ","Learn SQL! The institute does a good job introducing it, however if you see the ability to implement it in your practicum or a side project, I would highly recommend. It is so useful for interviews and is just a great tool. ",Don't get too stressed about this TIPS project. It just is setting the tone for presenting the analytical work going forward. It's not meant to be perfect!,,2022
"Take the time to get to know your classmates. I started going to social events as early as the primer, and I'm so glad I did. Even if it feels outside your comfort zone to go to an event where you barely know anyone, take the chance, you'll be glad you did. This program is really enhanced by the people, both inside and outside the classroom. ","As someone who strives to understand all the details before arriving at the big picture, I struggled at points to grasp some of the statistical/mathematical concepts that are taught here. Looking back, I wish I had stressed about this less - there is simply not the time for it. One thing that can help is studying with others or asking them for help - listening to them explain a concept that is difficult for you to understand may be the missing key after you've spent hours staring at slides from class. Additionally, if you feel stuck, just try SOMETHING. Especially with coding, a few rounds of trial and error may be all you need.","Create a personal system to keep track of deadlines for assignments, quizzes, etc. Whether that's using a calendar/calendar blocking, a task tracker, or something else, I found it very helpful to be able to look ahead to the next few weeks and understand how I was going to have to manage my time to get all of the work done. While a lot of the work is individual in the summer, this is complicated by the fact that so much of what you'll be working on in the fall is teamwork. Sometimes it was impossible to work ahead, but knowledge is power. Also pro tip - friends don't let friends forget their quizzes!","Don't skimp on preparing for interviews. As a sometimes socially anxious person who struggles with speaking eloquently in high pressure situations, I think I would have been a lot more successful during interview season if I had taken the time to craft strong examples of how I excel with technical projects and refresh my memory of statistical concepts learned in the fall. While I knew I SHOULD prepare, the task felt overwhelming, and I more or less procrastinated until it was too late. While you can't possibly know everything, feeling prepared with a few great examples for both technical and behavioral questions will go a long way - be sure to practice saying them out loud!",2022
"A great method to study for quizzes/exams is to rewatch lectures. It is sometimes difficult to capture all the information the first time in class, so listening to it a second time and taking notes helps.","Try to prepare for Spring 1 as much as possible. It is such a busy time with interviewing, and you still have a heavy workload with classes. If you can, try and get ahead with networking prior to this semester.","It is totally normal to feel stressed and anxious throughout this program, especially at the start as you are adjusting to the pace and rigor. Just know that you will learn to adapt each time you overcome a new challenge and will come out a lot more confident on the other side.",,2022
Take good notes! You are learning a lot of material in a short period of time so don't wait until last minute to organize your notes.

Make sure to eat, sleep, and have fun as much as possible!","Get your certifications as early as possible. It'll be tempting to say that you'll get your certifications over winter break, but when that time comes you will likely just want to relax. I'd recommend finding a friend to line up your certification schedule with so you can hold each other accountable and study together.","Be confident during interview season.

I had major anxiety coming into this experience, especially being someone with minimal workforce experience and almost no relevant experience. Seeing how qualified and experienced so many of my classmates were really made me worry about my ability to have success. But this isn't something that should bring you down. You hardly ever work alone so having brilliant classmates is a huge advantage! Try to learn from them.  But more importantly, understand that you are smart and capable enough to navigate this program. You will bring something strong to the table.

Make sure you use the career services resources available to you and take the time to get those certificates. You won't have a lot of time to spare during this busy program so make sure you focus your attention and time on what you want, and don't waste time stressing too much and comparing yourself to others.","Always ask for and be open to feedback. This is your last chance before starting a professional career to get feedback in an educational, low stakes setting. You can use this chance to get an honest assessment of how well you work individually and as a teammate or team lead.","Remember to take some time to relax and destress. Your brain will need it.

Don't be afraid to admit when you're wrong. It goes a long way when interacting with team members. You never want to be the person who wastes everyone's time when you know you are wrong. You also will gain the respect of every team member once you become comfortable admitting when you're wrong.,"Your time at the IAA will come and go faster than you think. You can always go back and re-learn material as necessary, but it's much harder to reach out to people and build relationships after you've left. Put in the effort and make meaningful relationships with your practicum teammates because those will mean more than any technical material you learn during your time. ","Although networking may seem like an extremely daunting task, if you start networking in the Fall it will pay dividends if you reconnect with those people come the job search. All you have to do is ask if people are available for a 30 minute chat to discuss their company, position, and background. Then reconnect in the Spring to ask how they've been, about their current projects, and if they are aware of any open positions. There is a vast alumni network and all alumni are more than happy to talk with current students.

You can even coordinate privately with one or two people to achieve a ""critical mass"" before passing along the invitation to the full class.

"Peer feedback is the most useful thing you will get out of this program. Be really thoughtful in how you approach giving and receiving feedback. Being honest and detailed helps you evaluate your own reactions too - if you thought someone was slacking, but when you make a list of what they did you find they were not, you will need to evaluate why you thought that about the person. It can help you notice your unconscious biases, and also what you do unconsciously that affects others. However, do take care to make your feedback as anonymous as possible. While you might not care if someone figures out that your feedback comes from you, if it's obvious which comments are yours you just made it that much easier to figure out who gave the other feedback on your team - and your teammates may not appreciate that.","Make extra coaching appointments. While you may only be required to do them at certain times, there are no rules that you can't have them more frequently or during a critical period.

Any topic out there has a number of questions that can be addressed with analytics. Scope out a side project surrounding that topic, and tackle it.

It’s not just an opportunity to learn a lot about the data science and analytics, it’s also an opportunity to learn and develop a lot of soft skills. Don’t just rely on the faculty and staff, as well as your classmates, to teach you things; you also need to be self-reliant. Nothing worthwhile is handed to you; you have to work for it. So, take this time to understand, challenge, and develop yourself. Think about your likes and dislikes, the type of people you want to work with and the type of person you want to be.

People love talking about themselves, so striking a good conversation isn't that hard if you're genuinely interested in what they do or how they got there. If someone has an interesting experience or background that you want to learn more about, then just reach out and ask for a phone call or email discussion. Try to have at least a few discussions after info sessions. They are a huge help regardless of whether you pursue a career where that person works! The same applies to our faculty and staff -- just about everyone who comes to the IAA is awesome and you'll have a great time talking to them and learning from them if you make an effort.","Don't be afraid to ask questions. It's a habit that you can reinforce with practice and feel more comfortable about with time. Ask questions in class if you feel comfortable, but especially ask questions with your practicum team and homework teams. Even having one person on a team who asks questions can make a huge impact and make others feel comfortable about asking questions, too. Almost every scenario of 5 people will have someone who seems like they completely understand everything, someone who is fairly lost, and someone who is right in the middle -- so don't feel alone if you don't understand something. The best way for everyone to learn is to feel comfortable admitting these things and then discuss your thoughts. The best part is that it typically helps other people realize things they thought they understood but didn't -- so it helps everyone. ",,,2020

","In the interviews, clearly state why you want to work for that particular company- even if they don't ask! Tying this in to your ""tell me about yourself"" introduction is a great strategy.

One strategy to retain a little bit more is to continuously evaluate if you can use any of the methods on your practicum project. Tackling a problem using multiple approaches can provide insight.
